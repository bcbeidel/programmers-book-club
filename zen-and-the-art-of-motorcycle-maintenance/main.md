## Gumption

> A person filled with gumption doesn’t sit around dissipating and stewing about things. He’s at the front of the train of his awareness, watching to see what’s up to the track and meeting it when it comes. That’s gumption.

## Gumption Trap

> A gumption trap is an event or mindset that can cause a person to lose enthusiasm and become discouraged from starting or continuing a project.

Two primary categories of a gumption trap according to the author, external 'Setbacks' and internal 'hang-ups' which are detailed primarily in Chapter 26.

## Setbacks: Out-Of-Sequence-Reassembly

Following the example of the reassembly of major components and the 'out-of-sequence-reassembly' trap the author provides two ways to fight against them, and salvage 'Gumption.'

 1. Deliberate, painstaking notes
 2. Physically mapping out the work with the pieces to see how it all goes together

## Setbacks: Intermittent Failure

> Failures that occur on rare occasion, seemingly without reason, and require thoughtful consideration to address the cause by understanding the variables that cause it.

## Setbacks: Parts Setback

> Inadequate parts to get the job done

## Hang-ups: Value Traps

> Block effective understanding
- Value Rigidity (South Indian Monkey Trap)
- Ego (Hubris?)
- Anxiety
- Boredom
- Impatience

## Hang-ups: Truth Traps

> Block cognitive understanding
- The limitation of questions to the binary 'Yes/No Logic' (mu)

## Hang-ups: Muscle Traps

> Block psychomotor behavior
- Inadequate Tools
- Improper Surroundings
- Muscular Insensitivity (Not being delicate when necessary / lacking the 'Mechanics Feel')
