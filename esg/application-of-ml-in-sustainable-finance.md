### Three Interrelated phenomena (p. 4)

> 1. Correlation between ESG and increased returns is fairly well established (Deutsche Bank, 2012; Eccles, Ioannou, and Serafeim, 2012; Allianz Global Investors, 2015; Cambridge Associates and the Global Impact Investing Network, 2017; Mercer and LGT Capital Partners, 2015; Morgan Stanley, 2015; Eccles, Verheyden, and Feiner, 2016; Khan, Serafeim, and Yoon, 2015). A recent study demonstrated that listed companies with good ESG practices show lower stock return volatility in comparison to reference companies – 28.6 percent lower, on average. Meanwhile, the average positive effect on equity return is 6.1 percent higher for companies with good ESG practices (Kumar et. al., 2016). Assessing the relationship between ESG and performance in over 2,200 studies from 1970 through 2014, Friede, Busch, and Bassen show that 90 percent demonstrate a positive correlation (2015). Market feedback goes in the same direction: 68 percent of asset owners say the integration of an ESG strategy has significantly improved returns, according to a State Street Global Advisors study (2017). 
> 2. ESG analysis is becoming more refined, expert, and widespread. What started as straightforward negative screening of certain assets is now a robust qualitative and quantitative assessment of equities. This includes the examination of company reports or data provided by third party ESG/CSR service providers. ESG can also be integrated in fixed income portfolios by conducting ESG credit rating analysis and assessing issuer level ESG data. Asset owners and asset managers can integrate ESG data using a plethora of benchmarks, studies, and guidelines. 
> 3. Similar to ML, pressure from younger asset owners is driving ESG integration. A handful of studies show that millennials, more than any previous generation, are prioritizing social and environmental issues when choosing an investing strategy (United States Trust Company, 2017; World Economic Forum, 2013; Deloitte, 2017). For almost half (49 percent) of millennials with a net worth of more than US$1 million, social responsibility is a factor in choosing an investment. This compares to 43 percent of Gen Xers, 34 percent of Baby Boomers, and 27 percent of seniors (Spectrem Group, 2015). 

### Using ML in ESG (p. 5)

#### Machine Learning and ESG: Current State and Limitations on Adoption

ML, then, can be applied in a number of major ways that build upon each other. In order of development, these applications include: 

> 1. Using natural language processing, speech recognition, and image processing tools based on ML technologies to infer crucial ESG information ahead of, or not available through, data providers; 
> 2. Imputing ESG data for currently unmeasured companies by detecting patterns within the full set of ESG metrics; and 
> 3. in the longer term, utilizing existing/available high quality ESG data, together with asset managers’ specific material financial data (often also collected through machine learning), to augment and optimize investment decision making by identifying materially relevant metrics and predicting future financial performance.

### Modeling Investment Return 

- **Materiality:** The first area in which ML might be applied is in determining materiality – which ESG metrics are material to future financial or asset price performance. To directly estimate materiality, researchers can use linear models to predict financial performance. 

- **Predicting Future Performance:** - Machine learning algorithms can also be used to predict future performance. Although linear models are best for determining materiality, they are frequently less accurate than ML models for predicting future performance.

- **Investment Risk:** - Machine learning tools can be used to model investment risk in addition to investment return. 

#### Other Notes

- Real time monitoring for ESG data (i.e., does their practice meet expectations)
    - NLP on 10ks, Social Media, or other data sources
    - Image analysis on worksites for identified waste
- Framed as time series problem
- Imputation of ESG metrics where little data is available
