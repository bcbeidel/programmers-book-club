###Falsely Blaming Yourself
>If an error is possible, someone will make it. The designer must assume that all possible errors will occur and design so as to minimize the chance of the error in the first place, or its effects once it gets made. Errors should be easy to detect, they should have minimal consequences, and, if possible, their effects should be reversible.

Misconceptions of Everyday Life
>Mental models, our conceptual models of the way objects work, events take place, or people behave, result from our tendency to form explana- tions of things. These models are essential in helping us understand our experiences, predict the outcomes of our actions, and handle unex- pected occurrences. We base our models on whatever knowledge we have, real or imaginary, naive or sophisticated.
>Mental models are often constructed from fragmentary evidence, with but a poor understanding of what is happening, and with a kind of naive psychology that postulates causes, mechanisms, and relation- ships even where there are none. Some faulty models lead to the frus- trations of everyday life, as in the case of my unsettable refrigerator, where my mental model of its operation (figure 1.9 A) did not corre- spond to reality (figure 1.9 B). Far more serious are faulty models of such complex systems as an industrial plant or passenger airplane. Misunderstanding there can lead to devastating accidents.

Blaming the Wrong Cause
>In all cases, whether a person is inappropriately accepting blame for the inability to work simple objects or attributing behavior to environ- ment or personality, a faulty mental model is at work.

LEARNED HELPLESSNESS
It refers to the situation in which people experience failure at a task, often numerous times. As a result, they decide that the task cannot be done, at least not by them: they are helpless.

TAUGHT HELPLESSNESS
The problem is that once failure starts, it soon generalizes by self-blame to all of mathematics. Similar processes are at work with technology. The vicious cycle starts: if you fail at something, you think it is your fault. Therefore you think you can't do that task. As a result, next time you have to do the task, you believe you can't so you don't even try. The result is that you can't, just as you thought. You're trapped in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Seven Stages of Action
Forming the goal
• Forming the intention
• Specifying an action
• Executing the action
• Perceiving the state of the world
• Interpreting the state of the world
• Evaluating the outcome

The Seven Stages of Action as Design Aids

• Visibility. By looking, the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action.
A good conceptual model. The designer provides a good conceptual model for the user, with consistency in the presentation of operations and results and a coherent, consistent system image.
 Good mappings. It is possible to determine the relationships between actions and results, between the controls and their effects, and be- tween the system state and what is visible.
 Feedback. The user receives full and continuous feedback about the results of actions.
