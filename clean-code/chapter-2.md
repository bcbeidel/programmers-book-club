# Chapter Two: Meaningful Names

## Synopsis

**Good names are important.**  The clear intent of code by way of deliberate naming saves time when coming back to change the code. __(i.e., the reduction of cost of task switching through faster comprehension)__

___

## Key Takeaways

1. **A good name answers the following questions:**
    * Why does it exist?
    * What does it do?
    * How is it used? 

2. **Some qualities of a good name include:**
    * **Avoids disinformation.**  Similar names suggest similarity of use/meaning.  Characters like 0 and l are difficult to distinguish.
    * **Makes Meaningful Distinctions.**  Noise words (*the*variable) and number-series naming (*a1, a2, a3*) are examples of distinctions that lack meaning.
    * **Reflects Natural Language.**  Provides easier communication when discussing code, and reading it. Makes the code searchable.
    * **CLASSES and OBJECTS** names should use **NOUNS**  
    * **METHODS** names should use **VERBS**
    * **Avoid colloquialisms, turn-a-phrase, or puns.**  If it requires a specific background to understand it muddles the meaning
    * **One Word One Concept.**  Consistent verbiage for concepts keeps it simple when switching around in code.
    * **Provides *sufficient* not *excessive* context**

## Potential Discussion Questions:

* Are there any tools or techniques you use to help define your common vocabulary for a project?  
* In situations where this overlap between 'Domain' and 'Techincal' keywords, how do you ensure there is no confusion?  Can you describe any specific scenarios and how the overlap was handled them well (or poorly)?
* Are there any qualities of 'good' names that were mentioned in this chapter that don't seem to provide dated guidance? Why?
