# Chapter Four:  Comments

## Synopsis

Comments represent a failure to accurately represent the core concept of the code in its naming and implementation.  If you are about to write a comment, think first for a way to more clearly express the intent of your code.

## Key Takeaways

 For this chapter, I honestly didn't see much more in the way worth documenting.   I keep coming back to the idea that comments represent failure and should be avoided unless there is a compelling reason to add a comment.  If anything we could highlight what attributes we think to make for especially heinous crimes of comment.

 The one potential distinction, is comments that are used to help autogenerate documentation. However, I still feel that because an update to a function requires update to both the comment and documentation there continues to be a risk of the documentation not reflecting the reality of code.  To me, having documentation forgive poorly named functions, variables, or unclear signatures that do not clearly express the intent of what is going on.
