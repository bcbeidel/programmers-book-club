# Chapter One: Clean Code

## Synopsis
Bad code is expensive to maintain, modify and migrate from.  Clean code is less expensive to maintain and modify.  Time spent 'wading' through bad code is time lost to otherwise productive pursuits.

___

## Key Takeaways

1. **Bad code is expensive to maintain.**  As we come back to make changes, it is harder to understand the impact of our changes in bad code making the changes take longer (and are more expensive)

2. **'Clean Code'** can have many definitions but some attributes from text included:
    * Can be read and modified by someone other than the original author
    * The intent of the code is clear.  There are no surprises when looking at methods or objects.  I.E., you get what you are expecting
    * All components of the code, classes, functions, etc... are focused on doing one thing and doing it well.
    * Includes and runs tests
    * Does not create excessively complex abstractions, and limits the number of classes and objects

3. **The Boy Scout Rule:** _'Try and leave this world a little better than you found it...'_
    * __We spend more time reading code than writing it.__  (10:1 ratio p.13)
    * When touching code, quick comprehension is key, 'making it easier to read makes it easier to write' (p.14)

## Potential Discussion Questions

* Of the multiple definitions for 'Clean Code' provided in the first chapter, did any definitions seem more or less relevant to you?  
* Where there any recurring themes that stood out across multiple definitions?
* What are some strategies that you have used to balance speed of delivery and code quality?
