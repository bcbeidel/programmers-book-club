# IAM 101

IAM (Identity access management) allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.

### IAM 101: Why IAM?

IAM provides:

- centralized control of AWS account
- shared access to AWS account
- granular Permissions
- identity Federation 
    - i.e., single sign on with other organizations credentials (i.e., okta, facebook, google)
- multi-factor authentication
- temporary access to resources
- password rotation services
- 
- is PCI/DSS compliant

### IAM 101: Critical Terms

- **Users** -- End users, such as employees of an organization
- **Groups** -- A collection of users under one set of permissions
- **Roles** -- You create roles and assign them to AWS resources 
- **Policies** -- A document that defines one or more permissions 

## IAM 101: Lab

### IAM Lab: Recommended Security Minimums

- Delete root access keys (remove 'god mode')
- Use multi-factor authentication on root
- Create individual IAM users
- Use groups to assign permissions
- Apply an IAM password policy

### IAM Lab: Navigating the console

- Users can be granted password, or programmatic access
    - i.e., username + password
    - or... secret and access keys
- Policies can be attached to groups or individual users
- Password settings can be enforced (recycle 120 days, prevent reuse)

### IAM Lab: Other notes

- IAM is universal, (not region specific), i.e., they all affect all regions
- root access is the first account you created the account
- users have no permission when first logging in

-- **Don't store credentials... use roles**

## IAM - Exam Tips

- **Users** -- End users, such as employees of an organization
- **Groups** -- A collection of users under one set of permissions
- **Roles** -- You create roles and assign them to AWS resources 
- **Policies** -- A document that defines one or more permissions 

- IAM is universal, not region specific
- "root account" is first account created when you setup the account.  It has full admin access
- New users have no permissions when created
- New users are `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Keys` when created
    - grants access to apis and command line, not admin console
    - only viewable once

## IAM Best Practice

- Always set up `Multi-factor Authentication` on the root account
- create password rotation policies
