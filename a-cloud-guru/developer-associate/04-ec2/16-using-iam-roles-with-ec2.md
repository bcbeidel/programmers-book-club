Attach roles to EC2 instances rather than giving credentials.

## Exam Tips

- Roles are more secure than storing your access key and secret access key on individual EC2 instances
- Roles are easier to manage, you can update across multiple instances at once
- Roles can be assigned to an EC2 instance while it is running
- Role are universal, i.e., you can use them in any region
