# EBS 101

- **EBS** - Amazon Elastic Block Storage provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.  Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its `Availability Zone` to protect from component failure, offering high availability and durability.

- **IOPS** - (Input/Output Operations Per Second, pronounced i-ops) is a common performance measurement used to benchmark computer storage devices like hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD), and storage area networks (SAN).
