# DNS 101

## What is DNS?

- **DNS:** The Domain Name System (or DNS) converts human readable domain names (like: www.google.com) into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (like: 173.194.39.78).

- IP addresses come in two different forms
    - IPv4 (32 bit i.e., over 4 billion address)
        - IPv4 is running out. IPv6 was created to answer
    - IPv6 (128 bit i.e., over 3.4*10^22)

For a sense of magnitude, if each IP address is a grain of sand, all IPv4 addresses would fill a dumptruck, all hte IPv6 addresses would fill the sun. 

## Top Level Domains

- **Top-level domain (TLD:)** refers to the last segment of a domain name, or the part that follows immediately after the "dot" symbol. TLDs are mainly classified into two categories: generic TLDs and country-specific TLDs. Examples of some of the popular TLDs include .com, .org, .net, .gov, .biz and .edu.

- **Second-level domain:** (SLD or 2LD) is a domain that is directly below a top-level domain (TLD). For example, in example.com, example is the second-level domain of the .com TLD.
