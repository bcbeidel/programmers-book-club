# S3 Basics

### S3: Exam Tips

- `S3` is object based storage.  i.e., it allows you to upload files
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB
- Unlimited storage
- Files are stored in buckets (i.e., online folders)
- S3 is a universal namespace, Bucket names are universally unique

- When you upload a file, on success you receive a **HTTP 200 Code**.

- Not suitable for installing and OS
- All buckets are private by default, can be managed down the the individual file level
    - Manageable by Bucket policies
    - Access control lists

### S3: Fundamentals

Attributes for an object

- Key (name of the object) 
- Value (data, i.e., sequence of bytes)
- Version ID (important for versioning)
- Metadata (data about data you are storing)

### S3: Data Consistency

- new object (`PUTS`)
    - Read after Write consistency
- overwrite (`PUTS` and `DELETES`)
    - eventual consistency (some time to propagate) 

## S3: Classes of Storage

1) S3 Standard
    - 99.99% availability
    - 99.99999999% durability (11 -9s)
    - stored redundantly across multiple devices
    - designed so sustain the loss of to facilities concurrently
2) S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed)
    - for data accessed less frequently, but requires rapid low-latency access when you need it.
    - lower fee than `S3` but you are charged an access fee
3) S3 One Zone - IA (Infrequently Accessed)
    - lower fee than IA
    - no multi-Availability Zone data resilience
4) S3 - Intelligent Tiering
    - uses ML to move storage to cost effective tier
5) S3 - Glacier
    - secure, durable and low-cost
    - configurable retrieval time from a few minutes to a few hours
6) S3 - Glacier Deep Archive
    - lowest cost storage class
    - retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable

## S3: Encryption

- Encryption In Transit
    - SSL/TLS
- Encryption at Rest
    - S3 Managed Keys 
        - SSE-S3
    - AWS Key Management Service - Managed Keys 
        - SSE-KMS
    - Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys 
        - SSE-C

## S3: Versioning

- Stores all versions of an object, even if you delete the object
- Great backup tool
- Once enabled, cannot be disabled
- Integrates with life cycle rules
- Includes MFA delete capability

## S3: life cycle Management

- Automates moving your objects between storage tiers
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- can be applied to current or 

## S3: Transfer Acceleration

File is uploaded to an edge location, which is then propagated async to bucket.  Edge location is closer

- separate URL
- in shorter time to get to an edge location rather than from S3

## S3: Cross Region Replication

- Cross-region replication is a feature that enables automatic and asynchronous copy of your data from one destination bucket to another destination bucket located in one of the other 15 AWS regions.
    - i.e., Files in one bucket, are automatically replicated to another region and bucket

Notes:

    - Delete marker not replicated...
    - Regions must be unique
    - File in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically
    - versioning must be enabled on source and destination buckets
