# _The Tao of Pooh_ by Benjamin Hoff

## _The How of Pooh?_
### _"The Vinegar Tasters"_
In Eastern art, there is an allegorical image of three men dipping their fingers into a vat of vinegar.  The image shows the three men who have dipped their fingers into the vat and each with a unique reaction.  Each man represents one of the masters of an Eastern Philosophy, specifically Confucius   (Confucianism), Buddha (Buddhism) and Lao-tse (Taoism).  (p.2)

#### Confucius, aka notorious Kong Fuzi (Confucianism)
Confucius has the look of 'sour-grapes' on his face.  The author summarizes his this reaction in the following manner to embody the philosophy.  (p.3)
* The present is out of step with the past; the government of men is out of step with the harmony of the heavens.
* Strong emphasis on reverence to the ancestors.  Rituals and ceremonies that center around the emperor (i.e. the Son of Heaven).
* Everything must be in the proper order, place and time.
    + _"If the mat were not straight, the Master would not sit."_

#### Buddha (Buddhism)
Buddha has a 'bitter look' on his face.  The author boils down the philosophy to suggest that the world is a _'Setter of Traps'_ that take an individual away from the path. (p.3-4)
* Life on earth is filled with desires that lead to attachments and desires that ultimately lead to suffering
* Transcending the 'world of dust' is required to reach Nirvana
* The Chinese altered the original philosophy from India and gave it a more positive outlook

#### Lao-Tse (Taoism)
Lao-Tse is smiling in the image, despite having tasted the same vinegar as the other two. (p.4-5)  The high points of description are as such:
* Earth is a reflection of heaven, not of the rules of men
* _"The further that man moves from the universal laws, the more struggles that are inevitable"_
* The world is not a setter of traps, but instead a teacher of valuable lessons

##### __ ** Tao - "The Way" ** __
* The universe cannot be described in words; but a quiet understanding is possible.
> A subtle sense of humor is apparent even in the most profound Taoist writings
