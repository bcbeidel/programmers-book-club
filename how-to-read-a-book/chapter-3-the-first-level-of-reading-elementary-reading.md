# Chapter 3: The First Level of Reading Elementary Reading

## Three Historical Trends

1. The effort to educate all citizens is vastly different than the historical perspective of teaching a few highly motivated students
2. Changes in the mechanism of teaching the basics of reading
    - ABC's -> Learn every combination of ABC and build on the sounds
    - Phonic Method -> learn sound combinations, build to words and complex sentences 
    - visual recognition -> recognize whole words/sentences before looking at the components
3. Parents, self-styled experts, even educators have a long history of criticising the educational system


## Stages of Learning To Read

1. Reading Readiness - (PreK / Kindergarden)
    - Physical readiness -> Good vision and hearing
    - Intellectual readiness -> Visual perception, and ability to take in a few words 
    - Language readiness -> can speak clearly
    - Personal readiness -> work with others, sustain attention, follow directions
2. Learning to Read Simple Materials (1st / 2nd Grades)
    - Tools include
        - Learn sight words
        - use of context clues
        - beginning sounds of words (i.e., sound it out)
    - By the end, pupils are expected to read simple books independently
3. Vocabulary Building (2nd - 4th)
    - Expected to improve the ability to 'unlock' the meaning of a word through context clues
    - Learn to read for different purposes, science, social studies, language arts, etc...
4. Refinement of previous skills (5th - 8th)
    - ideally reached in their early teens, and built upon

> Typically, the four stages of elementary reading are attained with the help of living teachers.  Children differ in their abilities, of course; some need more help than others.  But a  teacher is usually present to answer questions and smooth over difficulties that arise during the elementary years. (p. 27)

## Reading and the Democratic Ideal of Education

> We must be more than a nation of functional literates.  We must become a nation of truly competent readers, recognizing all that the word competent implies.  Nothing less will satisfy the needs of the world that is coming. (p. 30)
