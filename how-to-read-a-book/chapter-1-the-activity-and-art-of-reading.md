# Chapter 1: The Activity and Art of Reading

## Active Reading

Passive reading is impossible.

- __Analogy__: The reader is the catcher of a baseball, the author is the pitcher or batter.
    - The reader moves to respond to the author's ideas, (i.e., move to catch the ball)
    - Transmission of the concept requires that the author 'wants' to be received

## Reading For Information vs. Reading for Understanding

Understanding comes from the reader "lifting themselves up by their bootstraps" to more comprehensively comprehend the author's message.  Going to another person to explain

- Reading for information
    - facts -> information
    - the reader is capable of understanding all of the concepts without puzzlement (i.e., read the newspaper)

- Reading for understanding
    - insights -> understanding
    - Requirements: 
        - `initial inequality in understanding`
        - `the ability for the reader to overcome this inequality to some degree`.

## Learning by Instruction vs. Learning by Discovery

Are you able to recall something or can you explain it?  Being solely capable of reiteration of the fact is an exercise in memory but does not convey a deeper understanding of the context of the author.

> Being informed is prerequisite to being enlightened.  The point, however, is not to stop at being informed. (p. 11)

We can gain knowledge with the aid of a teacher be it in-person or writing, or through the act of initial discovery.  Adler rephrases this to be `aided` and `un-aided` discovery.  The primary distinction being the material.  

- `aided` methods (instruction) rely upon the help of a teacher.  

> A learner acts on something communicated to him.  He performs operations on discourse, written or oral.  He learns by acts of reading or listening. (p. 13)

- `un-aided` methods proceed without the help of a teacher.

> the learner proceeds without the help of any sort of teacher, the operations of learning are performed on nature or the world rather than on discourse. (p. 13)

Learning is multi-dimensional

> Thinking is only part of the activity of learning.  One must also use one's senses and imagination.  One must observe, and remember, and construct imaginatively what cannot be observed. (p. 13)
