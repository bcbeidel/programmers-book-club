# Notes on _How to Read A Book_ by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren

# Chapter 1: The Activity and Art of Reading

## Active Reading

Passive reading is impossible.

- __Analogy__: The reader is the catcher of a baseball, the author is the pitcher or batter.
    - The reader moves to respond to the author's ideas, (i.e., move to catch the ball)
    - Transmission of the concept requires that the author 'wants' to be received

## Reading For Information vs. Reading for Understanding

Understanding comes from the reader "lifting themselves up by their bootstraps" to more comprehensively comprehend the author's message.

- Reading for information
    - facts -> information
    - the reader is capable of understanding all of the concepts without puzzlement (i.e., read the newspaper)

- Reading for understanding
    - insights -> understanding
    - Requirements: 
        - `initial inequality in understanding`
        - `the ability for the reader to overcome this inequality to some degree`.

## Learning by Instruction vs. Learning by Discovery
