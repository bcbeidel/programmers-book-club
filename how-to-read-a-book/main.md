# Notes on _How to Read A Book_ by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren

---

TL;DR

## Elementary Reading

Can you understand the words on the page?  Do you understand the language?  Do you have the reading skills expected from elementary school?

## Inspectional Reading: Systematic Skimming

Skim systematically, classify the book and be able to restate its structure.

1. Look at the title page and preface.  Read each quickly
2. Study the table of contents.
3. Check the index
4. Read the publisher blurb (dust jacket)
5. Look at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to the argument
6. Turn the page, dipping in here an there, reading a paragraph or two, sometimes several pages in sequence but never more than that.

## Analytical Reading

### What is the book about as a whole? 

1. Classify the book
2. Restate the contents, briefly and in your own words
3. Outline the major parts, and restate as you did the whole
4. Identify the problems the author is trying to solve

### What is being said in detail, and how?

5. Identify the key terms (i.e., concepts) from the author
6. Find the important sentences, identify which are propositions that support arguments
7. Restate the author's arguments
8. Account for problems that the author did or did not solve with their arguments

### Criticizing the book Fairly:  Is it true? What of it?

9. Don't criticize until you can say that you 'understand' the book.  Once you do, then you can say 'I agree,' OR 'I disagree,' OR 'I suspend judgment.'
10. Don't disagree combatively, or with emotional bias, assume there is a way to bridge the gap
11. Understand the difference between knowledge and personal opinions, support your argument with sound evidence and reasoning

Ways you can critique the author:

12. Show where the author is uninformed
13. Show where the author is misinformed
14. Show where the author is illogical
15. Show where the author analysis is incomplete
