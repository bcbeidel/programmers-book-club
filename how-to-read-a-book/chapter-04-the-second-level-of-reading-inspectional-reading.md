# Chapter 4: The Second Level of Reading: Inspectional Reading

> Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension. (p. 43)

## Types of Inspectional Reading

There are two types of inspectional reading:
- Systematic Skimming (Pre-reading)
- Superficial Reading

### Inspectional Reading I: Systematic Skimming

Your task is to identify if the book requires more careful reading, it is an opportunity to separate the chaff from the real kernels.

1. Look at the title page and preface.  Read each quickly
    - You should be able to identify the subject and categorize the book
2. Study the table of contents.
    - Obtain a general sense of the book structure
    - Use it as a roadmap
    - The author may have taken great pain to convey detail in the ToC
3. Check the index
    - it can provide a quick estimate of the range of topics covered
    - what other works are being referenced
4. Read the publisher blurb (dust jacket)
    - the author may have summarized the main points of their book
5. Look at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to the argument
    - check for summary statements in the opening or closing of those chapters
6. Turn the page, dipping in here an there, reading a paragraph or two, sometimes several pages in sequence but never more than that.
    - Read the last few pages; authors often feel the need to summarize their main points there

### Inspectional Reading II: Superficial Reading

> In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away. (p. 36)

> You will have a much better chance of understanding it on a second reading, but that requires you to have read the book through at least once. (p. 37)

Prematurely digging into footnotes, dictionaries, or other reference materials can be an impediment

## Reading Speeds

You should vary your rate of reading in accordance with the nature and complexity of the material.  The ability to vary the speed appropriately is the skill to focus on, faster is not always better.

## Fixation and Regressions

The habits of fixing your eye to a line, or regressing back to a point are wasteful...

> Place your thumb and first two fingers together.  Sweep this "pointer" across a line of type, a little faster than it is comfortable for your eyes to move.  Force yourself to keep up with your hand.  You will very soon be able to read the words as you follow your hand.

## Summary

- Skimming is a useful tool, providing a mental roadmap of the book
- Do not try to understand every word on every page the first time through
- The inspectional reading steps can be considered preparation for the analytical work to come
