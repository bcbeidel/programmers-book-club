# Chapter 5: How to Be a Demanding Reader

> Ask questions while you read--questions that you yourself must try to answer in the course of reading. (p. 46)

## The Essence of Active Reading: The Four Basic Questions a Reader Asks

1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail and how?
3. Is the book true in whole or in part?
4. What of it?

Inspectional reading answers questions 1 + 2.  Analytical reading is required for 3 and 4. Syntopical reading is helpful for additional context to answer 4.

## How to Make a Book Your Own (Marking a Book)

Some of Adler's suggestions include:

1. Underlining major points
2. Vertical lines a the margin to emphasis large blocks
3. Stars, asterisks in the margin to emphasize the 10-12 most essential things in the text
4. Numbers in the margin (order points of an argument, etc.)
5. Page numbers in the margin (refer to other pages)
6. Circle keywords
7. Writing fundamental questions or thoughts at the top or bottom of the page

## Three Kinds of Note-Making

- structural -> concerning the general layout/topic (Inspectional)
- conceptual -> concerning the shape of arguments (Analytical)
- dialetical -> concerning multiple books (Syntopical)

## Forming the Habit of Reading

Adler goes on to describe that knowing the rules is insufficient, and practice is required to do well.  In my opinion, This is reflective of the skill acquisition framework:

1. Unconscious Incompetence  -> I don't know anything about reading complex material
2. Conscious Incompetence    -> I know that there is material out there like 'How to Read A Book' on the topic
3. Conscious Competence      -> I've read the book but have to be deliberate about practicing the habits
4. Unconscious Competence    -> The skills are now habits; I do them automatically
