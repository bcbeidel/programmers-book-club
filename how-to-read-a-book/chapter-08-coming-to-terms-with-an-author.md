# Coming to Terms with an Author

A term is the basic element of communicable knowledge.  A term is not a just word, it is a word or collection of words used to communicate a concept unambiguously.  An author might use many words to explain the same term (i.e., a many words to one term) or one word can be the vessel for many terms (i.e., a one word to many terms) but by identifying those key terms they can provide indications that you have discovered an important location in the book.

> RULE 5. Find the important words and through them come to terms with the author.

## Finding The Key Words

Keep in mind the nature of the book.  Depending upon the intent, the book may use an otherwise common word in a specific, technical context, which makes it a more likely vessel for a 'term'.  Take for example the word "cause" in the context of discussing the statistical concepts of correlation of causation.  That word is likely candidate as a term with an explicit meaning in that context, that might not exist in a more generic text.

## Techincal Words and Special Vocabularies

Keywords may be indicated by:

- typographic indicators - quotation marks, italics
- explicit, repeated discussion of the word
- a precise definition of the thing the word is used to name

> Every field of knowledge has its own technical vocabulary. (p. 104)

Example: 

- "wealth" is a technical word for Adam Smith
- "species" is a technical word for Darwin

## Finding the meanings

> You have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meanings of the all the words in the context that you do understand (p. 106)
