# Chapter 2: The Levels of Reading

Each level builds upon the last...

## Level One: Elementary Reading

Characterized by the skills typically achieved before leaving elementary school.

> At this level of reading, the question of the reader is "What does the sentence say?" (p. 17)

## Level Two: Inspectional Reading

Characterized by an emphasis on time.  Read X number of pages in Y time. a.k.a. _skimming_ or _pre-reading_

> When reading at this level, your aim is to examine the surface of the book, to learn everything that the surface alone can teach you.  That is often a good deal. (p. 18)

## Level Three: Analytical Reading

Emphasis is on understanding, given unlimited time.

> analytical reading is hardly ever necessary if your goal of reading is simply information or entertainment.  Analytical reading is preeminently for the sake of understanding. (p. 19)

## Level Four: Syntoptical Reading

Reading many, not a single book and placing them in relation to one another.  a.k.a. _compariative_ reading

> the synoptical reader is able to construct an analysis of the subject that may not be in any of the books. (p. 20)
