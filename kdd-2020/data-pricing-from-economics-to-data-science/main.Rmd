## Instructor Summary

> It is well recognized that data are invaluable.  How can we assess the value of data objectively and numerically? Pricing data has been studied and practiced in dispersed areas and principles, such as economy, data management and data mining, electronic commerce, and marketing. In this tutorial, we try to present a unified and comprehensive overview of this important and long overdue pillar in data science and engineering.  We will examine various motivations behind data pricing, understand the economics of data pricing, review the development and evolution of pricing models, and compare the proposals of marketplaces of data.  We will also connect data pricing with several highly related areas, such as cloud service pricing, privacy pricing, and decentralized privacy-preserving infrastructure like blockchain.  In addition, we will align with the industry practice where real business is running. This tutorial will be highly interdisciplinary and will be indeed a fusion of academia foundations and industry practice. We do not assume any background knowledge and will make the essential ideas highly accessible to practitioners and graduate students.

### Data as Fundamental Resources

- Products and Services are being delivered in digital forms; generating first-party data
- The second use of data is in analytics and other "Big Data Applications."
- Sharing and reuse of data has profound implications on the economy
  - Consider traffic mapping applications. The first use of real-time traffic data is for the driver; the second use could be for governments and urban planners.
- Second use can enable fairness and innovation.  Universal availability of data can help with emerging initiatives or be used to advocate for minority parties.

### Measuring the value of data: Example Scenarios

A popular request in the business world.  How do you price it to enable the economic transaction? Consider a few scenarios.

1. Data Transmission (pay for the pipes)
    - Example: A mobile service provider offers a data package with smartphone service
    - How do you price data transmission?
        - Factors: data amount quota, location, transmission speed
        - Often agnostic of content, quality, collection storage, or processing?
        - Parallel: water or electric bill, pay on hookup + amount of usage.
2. Digital Products (pay for the content)
    - Example: A person watches a movie at home, where the film is delivered as a stream of data
    - Priced as a content product/service
        - Factors: content, resolutions...
        - Often agnostic of how data gets to the consumer
3. Data Products (pay for the stream or insights)
    - Example: use a weather forecasting service in business operations
    - Priced as a subscription, data product, or service
        - Factors: granularity, data horizon, analysis requirements, business reliance
        - Often independent of delivery, or if it is standard information for public

Data pricing is interdisciplinary, taking from economics, computation, and data science.

### Key Terms: Categories Of Products

#### **Digital Products**

Intangible goods that can be consumed through electronics. (e.g., ebooks, music, digital-ads, online coupons).  May have a physical correspondence with the consumer, but not required.

#### **Data Products**

Datasets as products and information services derived from datasets

#### **Information Goods**

Include digital and data products

### What is pricing?

The practice that a business sets a price at which a product can be sold.  Often part of the marketing plan. Often the result of a consideration of many objectives including:

- Profitability
- Fitness in the marketplace
- Market Positioning
- Price consistency
- Meeting or preventing competition

Many strategies in the economics of pricing tactics, beyond the scope of this tutorial...

### Technological Forces On Pricing: Cost Reduction

> "Technology changes. Economic laws do not."

- Cost reduction is a core in the production, distribution, and consumption of information goods when compared to physical goods. 
    - i.e., the unit cost a digital widget can be driven down much more than when compared to a physical widget.
- Cost reduction in Information Goods.
    - Search Costs
    - Production Costs
    - Replication Costs
    - Transportation Costs
    - Tracking and Verification Costs

### Search Costs

- The cost of looking for information
- Information goods allow for effective, efficient online search
    - Easier discovery of products and services
    - Easier price comparison
        - Example: Online books and music, vs. in-person
- Low search costs facility sale of rare, long-tail products
    - Results in greater variety, specialization in information goods and services
    - Recommender systems play an important role in deciding the degree of variety
    - **Echo Chamber Effect**: customers may tend to consume that which aligns with their viewpoints
    
#### Low Search Costs Lead To Platforms

**Platform businesses** provide matching services to customers, improve efficiencies.  STrategies for building and running these businesses include:

- Interoperability: the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information.
- Compatibility: two or more things can exist or work together in combination without problems or conflict.
- Standards: a required or agreed level of quality or attainment.

### Production Costs

- A wide range of costs are reduced substantially compared to traditional products
    - Materials, semi-finished products, transportation
- With sharing, the unit-cost of production can approach zero
- Information goods can often reduce costs of customization to extremes (i.e., ML content customization)

#### Low Production Costs Result In Distinct Business Models

Examples include Sharing economies, pay-as-you-go, query-based models (pay for the fraction you use).  Enables long-tail products.  

### Replication Costs

Since consumer A's consumption of information does not affect the availability or quality of the good for consumer B, it is considered non-rival.

Bundling is often used for zero-marginal cost, non-rival information goods.  The pressure often makes much of these publicly available.  Consider Wikipedia and Open Source Software.

#### Low Replication Costs Bring Challenges

- Challenging to copyright and policies and enforcement
- Zero marginal cost, ease the way for spamming and online crime

### Transportation Costs

- With the internet, the cost of transporting information goods approaches zero
    - Same information good available across the world
    - Local tastes still influence consumption (see low production costs)
- Regulations may put geo-specific constraints
    - Think China, blocking Wikipedia.
- Copyright policy may further affect the availability, consumption of information goods, which may be reflected in the price.

### Tracking And Verification Costs

Information goods providers can track users with relatively low costs, allowing for extensive personalization and possible price discrimination.

- Example: Behavioral Price Discrimination
    - Set prices according to previous behaviors
    - Implications on privacy, a well-versed user, may choose to hold information
- Example: Versioning
    - A different version of the product, different price.

The low cost of tracking and verification has a big beneficiary, personalized advertising.

### Distinctions between Digital and Data Products

- Digital Product
    - Unit of consumption often well defined, fixed (a movie)
    - Consumption of digital products, independent from one another (many movies)
    - An individual unit may not be valuable (Single movie not worth renting)
    - Often aggregated and consumed together (Netflix)
- Data Products
    - Have strong properties of flexibility and aggregation (buy data, make aggregate)
    - Typically consumed by machines, rather than people
    - Unlike digital products, can be consumed, reused in part or other ways, not exclusively as the whole

The boundary is fuzzy; consider social media.  In individual reading (digital product), when aggregated by machines, it can be thought of as data products.

### Economics of Data Pricing: Summary

- Information goods are distinct from traditional physical goods, by a significant reduction in costs
- Information goods see a substantial reduction in search costs, production costs, replication costs, transportation costs, tracking and verification costs
- Significant differences between digital products and data products: consumption units, aggregation, means of consumption, reuse and reselling
- The boundary between digital and data products is fuzzy.
