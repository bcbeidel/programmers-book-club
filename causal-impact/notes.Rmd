Notes related to Causal Inference with [CausalImpact](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html), R Package from Google. 

## Why Causal Inference?

Let's say we made changes to a policy, tool, campaign, or process we are running.  We may want to answer the question of what effect did change `X` have on our service?  The gold standard for estimating this effect is a [randomized control trial](#randomized-control-trial). However, that might be too difficult, too expensive, unethical, or simply because it wasn't done.  Causal inference is a technique designed to help estimate the impact of a change in cases where a randomized experiment is not an option.

## A simple example

On January 15, 2015, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) [announced it would no longer hold the Swiss franc at a fixed exchange rate with the euro](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2015/01/18/why-the-swiss-unpegged-the-franc).  The image below shows the exchange rate before the announcement, the observed value after treatment (`Y(1)`) and the expected exchange rate if no announcement had been made (i.e., the [counterfactual example](#counterfactual) `Y(0)`).

Key concepts in this image are:

- `Y(1)` is our observed data, what actually happened after the treatment 
- `Y(0)` is our [counterfactual](#counterfactual) estimate, or [synthetic control](#synthetic-control), or the expected outcome with no treatment
- `the causal effect estimate` is the difference between the observed `Y(1)` and the synthetic control `Y(O)`, or the difference between the two outcomes.

## The problem of causal inference

We cannot observe the potential outcomes with and without the treatment at the same time.  For instance, we cannot see a single patient's outcome if we administered and did not administer a drug at the same time.  The outcomes are mutually exclusive; to address this, our options are.

1. Run a controlled experiment, where we see some of the potential outcomes with and without treatment.
2. Use observational methods, to try to estimate the effect in the absence of a controlled experiment.
3. Master time travel.

## CausalImpact

What is the `CausalImpact` approach to this problem?

### Building A Model

In order to use the `CausalImpact` package, we need a few things.

1. Treatment at the time (t)
1. A time series of our target observation (`Y`)
   - This time series must be broken up into a `pre-period` and a `post-period` groups.
2. One more co-variate, "predictor" time-series sets (`X1`, and `X2`), that they themselves are not impacted by the treatment at the time (t).

We leverage these co-variate sets to estimate the synthetic-control, which we use to estimate our causal effect in the `post-period`.

## Key Questions

#### Question: How many co-variate (predictor) time series do you need to successfully to this analysis?

Relying on a single co-variate time series runs the risk of reacting quickly to the specifics of the co-variate series.  Instead, it is recommended that a handful or a few dozen co-variate time series be used.  Enough to guard against spurious correlations, but few that you can understand and explain what each of these time series means.

#### Question: Can you use this method to calculate the impact of multiple events if they overlap in time?

As of 2016, this was an open research question.  Need to do additional research to determine if this is still true.

#### Question: The causal impact estimate seems to be at the mercy of the confidence intervals.  Are tools to analyze and potentially reduce the confidence interval in that post-treatment period?

The confidence interval reflects the uncertainty in our prediction.  As you get further out into the future, you are less certain of the output and expect that confidence interval to expand.  The better your predictor series are explaining the target, the tighter your confidence intervals are likely to be.  The inverse of that, if you don't have any good predictor time series, then your confidence interval will be wide and reflect that uncertainty.

#### How do we identify 'good' predictor time-series?

## Key Term(s)

### Bayesian Structural Time Series

> Statistical technique used for feature selection, time series forecasting, nowcasting, inferring causal impact, and other applications. The model is designed to work with time-series data.
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_structural_time_series>

Consists of three primary components

1. Kalman filter ()
2. Spike-and-Slab
3. Bayesian Model Averaging

This is the technique leveraged under-the-hood of [CausalImpact](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/) package, and available in the [bsts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/bsts.pdf) R package on CRAN.

### Bayesian model averaging

### counterfactual

> Counterfactual conditionals (also subjunctive or X-marked) are conditionals which discuss what would have been true under different circumstances, e.g., "If it was raining right now, then Sally would be inside." Counterfactuals are characterized grammatically by their use of fake past tense marking, which some languages use in combination with other kinds of morphology, including aspect and mood.
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_conditional>

Consider the extension to marketing if we launch an ad campaign and observe the outcome. The counterfactual would be the outcome if we did not launch the campaign.

### causal inference

> The process of concluding a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect. The main difference between causal inference and inference of association is that the former analyzes the response of the effect variable when the cause is changed.
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference>

In this context, it could be thought of as the branch of statistics focused on effects, or the consequences of our actions.

### causality

>Influence by which one event, process, or state (a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, or state (an effect) where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause.  
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality>

_In simpler terms, `B` happened because of `A`._

### randomized control trial

> A randomized controlled trial (or randomized control trial RCT) is a type of scientific (often medical) experiment that aims to reduce certain sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of new treatments; this is accomplished by randomly allocating subjects to two or more groups, treating them differently, and then comparing them with respect to a measured response
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial>

In this example, each group would receive a distinct `treatment`.

### synthetic control

> The synthetic control method is a statistical method used to evaluate the effect of an intervention in comparative case studies. It involves the construction of a weighted combination of groups used as controls, to which the treatment group is compared. This comparison is used to estimate what would have happened to the treatment group if it had not received the treatment. 
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_control_method>

In other words, it is a technique where we generate a control group from existing data points.
