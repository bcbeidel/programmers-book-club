# Chapter 9: That Helps Them Avoid Failure

**Every human is trying to avoid a tragic ending.**  The only two motivations a hero has in a story are to escape something bad or experience something good. A story with nothing to lose lacks motivation for the hero.  This does not mean that we should be fear-mongers.  The concerns raised should be realistic and helpful framing for the customer.  However, the author suggests that most businesses do not convey the risks and their message falls flat.

## People are motivated by loss-aversion

The author cites Daniel Kahneman's 1979 theory that people are likely to be more dissatisfied with a $100 loss than satisfied with a $100 gain.  Suggesting loss aversion is a more powerful motivator. How do we curate such a message, citing the book _Building Communication Theory_, it proposes a four-step process of a "fear appeal."

1. Make the reader know they are vulnerable to a threat.
    - "Nearly 30% of all homes have evidence of termite infestations."
2. Let the reader know that since they are vulnerable to a threat, they should take action.
    - "Since nobody wants termites, you should do something to protect your home."
3. Let the reader know about a specific call to action that protects them from risk.
    - "We offer a complete home treatment that will ensure your house is free of termites."
4. Challenge people to take this specific call to action.
    - "Call us today and schedule your home treatment."

## Fear is salt in the recipe

Too much and people block you out, too little, and there isn't enough to get the desired effect of urgency.

## What are you helping the customer avoid?

What negative consequences are you helping the customer avoid?  Could they lose money, or risk their health?  What are the opportunity costs of not enlisting your services?  Some examples include:
  
- Perkins Motorplex (Used Cards)
  - Getting ripped off by a used-car salesman
  - Being stuck with a lemon
  - Feeling taken advantage of
- Rely Technology (Home A/V)
  - Living in a boring home
  - Nobody wants to watch the game at your house
  - You need a Ph.D. to turn on the TV
- MFG of Aerospace Equipment
  - Product failure, damaging your reputation
  - inefficient production
  - being passed by the competition
- Summer Camp
  - A long, boring summer
  - A bunch of restless kids at home
  - Regret about having wasted the Summer

This is intentionally limited to just a few bullets. You want to focus on your customer's success, but recognizing what failure might look like is a necessary component for contrast.
