# Building A Storybrand

Notes on [_Building a Storybrand: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen_](https://buildingastorybrand.com/) by Donald Miller.

## Section 1: Why Most Marketing Is A Money Pit

Two primary mistakes that muddle the message:

1. Failing to focus on what will make _the customer_ survive and thrive
2. You make the customer burn too many calories to understand the offer.

In short, noise is your enemy. Your customer is the hero. Don't make them think too hard to understand what you are offering them.

### Anecdote: Apple And Story

Apple started with a multi-page tech-focused writeup for macs, those ads bombed, simplified to the '[Think Different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different)' campaign met with success.

### Story in a Nutshell

Every compelling story has a few core components:  A **CHARACTER** who wants something encounters **A PROBLEM** before they can get it.  At the peak of their despair, A **GUIDE** steps into their lives gives them a **PLAN**, and **CALLS THEM TO ACTION**.  That action helps them avoid **FAILURE** and ends in a **SUCCESS**.

Examples:

> [Hunger Games] Katniss has to compete in a fight to the death tournament.  Meets Haymitch, who teaches her to play the PR game and get sponsors.  That gave her the edge to survive and avoided death to win.

Or consider Star Wars.

> [Star Wars] Luke must defeat the Empire.  Meets Obiwan Kenobi, who teaches him to trust the force.  That empowers Luke to overcome the Empire, avoiding the destruction of the rebellion.

At every point in these stories, you can answer these questions:

1. What does the hero want?
2. Who or what is opposing the hero from getting what they want?
3. What does the hero's life look like if they do or don't get what they want?

### The Grunt Test: Testing The Clarity of our message

In marketing, there are also simple questions that should be answered if we expect customers to engage with our brand.  If customers can't quickly answer these questions, they will check out.

1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make my life better?
3. What do I need to do to buy it?

## Section 2: Building A Storybrand (SB7 Framework)

The rest of the book walks us through how to hone the story.  It suggests that you stop to complete a draft for each component of the story at each stage before moving to the next.  From the introduction of the framework, there were some principles attached to each section.

1. **A Character**: The customer is the hero, not your brand.
2. **Has a Problem**: Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems.
3. **And Meets a Guide**: Customers aren't looking for another hero; they're looking for a guide.
4. **Who Gives Them a Plan**: Customers trust a guide who has a plan.
5. **And Calls Them To Action**: Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action.
6. **That Helps Them Avoid Failure**: Every Human is trying to avoid a tragic ending.
7. **And Ends in a Success**: Never assume people understand how your brand can change their lives.  Tell them.

Steps.  Read Each chapter.  Brainstorm Potential Messages To Fill Each Section of the [script](./Building-a-StoryBrand-Audio-Book-Images.pdf).  Review and pick one of your messages to use.  Move to the next chapter.

### Section 2.1: A Character

The customer is the hero, not your brand. The story opens with a hero who wants something.  Framing the message around the customer and their desires should be the focus. **Pare down the Customer's Ambition to a Single Focus**, having too many desires dilutes your objectives.

#### Defining Something The Customer Wants: Examples

Financial Advisor
: "A Plan for Your Retirement"

College Alumni Association
: "Leave a Meaningful Legacy"

Fine-Dining Restaurant
: "A Meal Everybody Will Remember"

Real Estate Agent
: "The Home You've Dreamed About"

Bookstore
: "A Story to Get Lost In"

Breakfast Bars
: "A Healthy Start to Your Day"

#### Choosing A Desire Relevant To Survival

By survival, the author means the primitive desire we all have to be safe, healthy, happy, and strong.  Survival simply means we have the economic and social means to eat, drink, reproduce, and stay physically safe.  Examples discussed in the text were:

- Conserving Financial Resources
- Conserving Time
- Building Social Networks
- Gaining Status
- Accumulating resources
- The Innate Desire to be generous
- The desire for meaning

#### What is the Story Question for your customer

> Imagine your customer is a hitchhiker.  You pull over to give them a ride, and the one burning question on his mind is simply _Where are you going?_.  But has he approaches you to roll down the window and start talking about your mission statement, or how your grandfather built this car with his bare hands, or how your road-trip playlist is all 1980's alternative.  This person does not care.  All he wants to do is to get to San Francisco with a flower in his hair.

The customer should know exactly where we want to take them.  Would they be able to repeat back exactly what your brand offers?

#### Action Required: Clarify The Message, So Customers Listen - A Character

1. **Stop, Breathe.**
2. Brainstorm answers to the question, "What does the character want?"
3. Capture the ideas, select one before moving forward.

### Section 2.2: Has A Problem

**Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems.**  That problem is the `hook` that draws people into the story.  The more we talk about our customers' experience, the more interest they will have in the brand.

#### Every Story Needs A Villain

A villain is the plot device to give conflict a clear point of focus.  Batman had the Joker; Luke had Darth Vader, Harry Potter had Voldemort. A good villain does not need to be a person but should have some essential characteristics.

1. **The Villain should be a root source.** Frustration is what a villain makes us feel; high taxes would be a better villain.
2. **The Villain should be relatable.** The villain should be immediately relatable.
3. **The Villain should be singular.** Too many, and the story lacks clarity.
4. **The Villain should be real.** Avoid fear-mongering

#### Three Levels Of conflict

Customers are trying to resolve problems at multiple levels, not just the external level that we associate with the villain.

1. External Problems
    - A Restaurant solves the external problem of hunger.  A plumber solves the external problem of a leaky pipe.
    - Many make the mistake of stopping here when describing the problems
2. Internal Problems:
    - The external problems are causing frustrations, and it is those internal frustrations that are motivating customers to call.
    - What is customer frustration?  How does our offering solve it?
    - The Apple example: People are intimidated by the tech talk associated with computers; they just want something easy to use. Apple provided easy to use computers that just worked, without forcing the tech talk on them.
3. Philosophical Problems
    - This is about something more significant than the story itself.  Why does the story matter?
    - Why is it important that Tommy Boy Saves his dad's company?  Because the people who are trying to take it are thieves and shouldn't succeed.
    - Why is it important that Hamlet avenge his Father's death?  Because otherwise, his Uncle would get away with murder.
    - The terms `ought` and `should` are the terms we should discuss the philosophical problems within. 
        - "Bad people shouldn't be allowed to win."
        - "People ought to be treated fairly."
    - Pet Store Example: Pet's deserve healthy food.
    - What is the grand injustice? What wrong *must* be righted?

#### The Perfect Brand Promises

We should position our brand as the resolution to external, internal, and philosophical problems and frame our product's purchase as the action required to create closure.  Some examples:

1. Tesla Cars
    - Villain: Gas Guzzling, inferior technology.
    - External: I need a car.
    - Internal: I want to be an early adopter of new technology.
    - Philosophical: My choice of car ought to have a positive impact on the environment.
2. Nespresso Home Coffee Machines
    - Villain: Coffee machines that make bad coffee.
    - External: I want better coffee at home.
    - Internal: I want my home coffee machine to make me feel sophisticated.
    - Philosophical: I shouldn't have to be a barista to make gourmet coffee at home
3. Edward Jones Financial Advisors
    - Villain: Financial firms that don't listen to their customers.
    - External: I need investment help.
    - Internal: I'm confused on how to do this.
    - Philosophical: If I'm going to invest my money, I deserve an advisor who sill thoughtfully explain things in person.

#### Action Required: Clarify The Message, So Customers Listen - Has a Problem

1. **Stop, Breathe.**
2. Brainstorm all the villains your brand stands against.
3. Brainstorm all the external problems that your brand resolves.  Is there one that represents the broadest swath of products?
4. Brainstorm all the internal problems (frustration or doubt).  Is there one that stands out as universal to all your customers?
   - Is your brand part of a larger, more important story?  Is there a philosophical wrong you stand against?
5. Capture the ideas.
