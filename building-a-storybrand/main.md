# Building A Storybrand

Notes on [_Building a Storybrand: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen_](https://buildingastorybrand.com/) by Donald Miller.

## Section 1: Why Most Marketing Is A Money Pit

Two primary mistakes, that muddle the message.

1. Failing to focus on what will make _the customer_ survive and thrive
2. You make the customer burn too many calories to understand the offer.

In short, noise is your enemy. Your customer is the hero. Don't make them think too hard to understand what you are offering them.

### Anecdote: Apple And Story

Apple started with multi-page tech focused writeup for macs, those ads bombed; simplified to the '[Think Different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different)' campaign met with success.

### Story in a Nutshell

Every compelling story has a few core components:  A **CHARACTER** who wants something encounters **A PROBLEM** before they can get it.  At the peak of their despair, A **GUIDE** steps into their lives, gives them a **PLAN**, and **CALLS THEM TO ACTION**.  That action helps them avoid **FAILURE** and ends in a **SUCCESS**.

Examples:

> [Hunger Games] Katniss has to compete in fight to the death tournament.  Meets Haymitch who teaches her to play the PR game and get sponsors.  That gives her the edge to survive and avoided death to win.

> [Star Wars] Luke must defeat the Empire.  Meets Obiwan Kenobi who teaches him to trust the force.  That empowers Luke to defeat the Empire avoiding the destruction of the rebellion.

At every point in these stories, you can answer these questions:

1. What does the hero want?
2. Who or what is opposing the hero from getting what they want?
3. What does the hero's life look like if they do or don't get what they want?

### The Grunt Test: Testing The CLarity of our message

In marketing, there are also simple questions that should be answered at all times if we expect customers to engage with our brand.  If customers can't quickly answer these questions, they will check out...

1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make my life better?
3. What do I need to do to buy it?

## Section 2: Building A Storybrand (SB7 Framework)

The rest of the book walks us through how to hone the story.  It suggests that at each stage, you stop to complete a draft for each component of the story before moving to the next.  From the introduction of the framework there were some principles attached to each section.

1. **A Character**: The customer is the hero, not your brand.
2. **Has a Problem**: Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems.
3. **And Meets a Guide**: Customer's aren't looking for another hero; they're looking for a guide.
4. **Who Gives Them a Plan**: Customers trust a guide who has a plan.
5. **And Calls Them To Action**: Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action.
6. **That Helps Them Avoid Failure**: Every Human is trying to avoid a tragic ending.
7. **And Ends in a Success**: Never assume people understand how your brand can change their lives.  Tell them.

Steps.  Read Each chapter.  Brainstorm Potential Messages To Fill Each Section of the [script](./Building-a-StoryBrand-Audio-Book-Images.pdf).  Review and pick one of your messages to use.  Move to next chapter.

### Section 2.1: A Character

The customer is the hero, not your brand. The story opens with a hero who wants something.  Framing the message around the customer and their desires, should be the focus. **Pare down the Customer's Ambition to a Single Focus**, having too many desires dilutes your objectives.

#### Choosing A Desire Relevant To Survival

By survival, the author means the primitive desire we all have to be safe, healthy, happy, and strong.  Survival simply means we have the economic an social means to eat, drink, reproduce and stay physically safe.  Examples discussed in the text were:

- Conserving Financial Resources
- Conserving Time
- Building Social Networks
- Gaining Status
- Accumulating resources
- The Innate Desire to be generous
- The desire for meaning

#### What is the Story Question for your customer

> Imagine your customer is a hitchhiker.  You pull over to give them a ride, and the one burning question on his mind is simply _Where are you going?_.  But has he approaches you roll down the window and start talking about your mission statement, or how your grandfather built this car with his bare hands, or how your road-trip playlist is all 1980's alternative.  This person does not care.  All he wants to do is to get to San Francisco with a flower in his hair.

The customer should know exactly where we want to take them.  Would they be able to repeat back exactly what your brand offers?

1. **Stop, Breathe.**
2. Brainstorm answers to the the question "What does the character want?"
3. Capture the ideas, select one before moving forward.
