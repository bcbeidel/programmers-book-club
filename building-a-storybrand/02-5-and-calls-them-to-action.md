# Section 2.5: And Calls Them To Action

**Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action.**  At this point, we have spoken directly to the customer.  We identified their challenges, empathized with their feelings, established our competence, and layed out a plan, but that is not enough.  They need a call to action.  Customers do not have ESP; we have to make a clear invitation to join us. Otherwise, they won't take that first step.

## Direct Calls to Action

It should be obvious what you want customers to do.  There should be a button that you want them to press, and it should be a direct call to action. Examples include:

- Order now
- Call today
- Schedule an appointment
- Register today
- Buy now

Include it in email blasts, ads, business cards, you name it.  You don't want potential customers waiting, wondering what they should do.  Make it clear to them.

## Transitional Calls To Action

There are calls to action that aren't 'Buy Now,' but instead are transitional calls to action that can provide value to your brand including:

1. Stake a claim to your territory.  Generate and share content that establishes you as the authority in an area.
2. Create Reciprocity. If you are generous with your free material, customers will be more likely to give something back.
3. Position Yourself As The Guide. If you help customers solve a problem, even for free, you position yourself as the guide.  The next time they come across a problem in that area, they will look to you for help.

Transitional Calls To Action can take many forms.  Including:

1. Free Information; Educate your customers and establish yourself as an authority.
2. Testimonials; If they see the success of another customer
3. Samples; Just like test-driving a car, being able to sit in the driver's seat if only for a time will increase customer comfort
4. Free Trials; A Risk Removal Policy that can help onboard your customers.
