# Building A Storybrand

Notes on [_Building a Storybrand: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen_](https://buildingastorybrand.com/) by Donald Miller.

## Section 1: Why Most Marketing Is A Money Pit

Two primary mistakes that muddle the message:

1. Failing to focus on what will make _the customer_ survive and thrive
2. You make the customer burn too many calories to understand the offer.

In short, noise is your enemy. Your customer is the hero. Don't make them think too hard to understand what you are offering them.

### Anecdote: Apple And Story

Apple started with a multi-page tech-focused writeup for macs, those ads bombed, simplified to the '[Think Different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different)' campaign met with success.

### Story in a Nutshell

Every compelling story has a few core components:  A **CHARACTER** who wants something encounters **A PROBLEM** before they can get it.  At the peak of their despair, A **GUIDE** steps into their lives gives them a **PLAN**, and **CALLS THEM TO ACTION**.  That action helps them avoid **FAILURE** and ends in a **SUCCESS**.

Examples:

> [Hunger Games] Katniss has to compete in a fight to the death tournament.  Meets Haymitch, who teaches her to play the PR game and get sponsors.  That gave her the edge to survive and avoided death to win.

Or consider Star Wars.

> [Star Wars] Luke must defeat the Empire.  Meets Obiwan Kenobi, who teaches him to trust the force.  That empowers Luke to overcome the Empire, avoiding the destruction of the rebellion.

At every point in these stories, you can answer these questions:

1. What does the hero want?
2. Who or what is opposing the hero from getting what they want?
3. What does the hero's life look like if they do or don't get what they want?

### The Grunt Test: Testing The Clarity of our message

In marketing, there are also simple questions that should be answered if we expect customers to engage with our brand.  If customers can't quickly answer these questions, they will check out.

1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make my life better?
3. What do I need to do to buy it?

## Building A Storybrand (SB7 Framework)

The rest of the book walks us through how to hone the story.  It suggests that you stop to complete a draft for each component of the story at each stage before moving to the next.  From the introduction of the framework, there were some principles attached to each section.

1. [**A Character**](./04-a-character.md): The customer is the hero, not your brand.
2. [**Has a Problem**](./05-has-a-problem.md): Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems.
3. [**And Meets a Guide**](./06-and-meets-a-guide.md): Customers aren't looking for another hero; they're looking for a guide.
4. [**Who Gives Them a Plan**](./07-who-gives-them-a-plan.md): Customers trust a guide who has a plan.
5. [**And Calls Them To Action**](./08-and-calls-them-to-action.md): Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action.
6. [**That Helps Them Avoid Failure**](./09-that-helps-them-avoid-failure.md): Every Human is trying to avoid a tragic ending.
7. [**And Ends in a Success**](./10-and-ends-in-a-success.md): Never assume people understand how your brand can change their lives.  Tell them.
