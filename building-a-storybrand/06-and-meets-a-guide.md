# Section 2.3: And Meets a Guide

**Customers are not looking for another hero; they are looking for a guide.**  Frodo has Gandalf, Kathiss has Hamitch, Luke has Yoda, Hamlet was guided by his father's ghost. People wake up self-identifying as the hero in their own story, troubled by their own internal, external and philosophical conflicts. The fatal mistake that companies make is that they position themselves as the hero in the story.

> The larger point here is simple: the day we stop losing sleep over the success of our business and start losing sleep over success of our customers is the day our business will start growing again.

## Two Characteristics of a Guide

1. **Expresses Empathy**
    - When we empathize with our customers' dilemma, we create a bond of trust.
    - Empathetic statements start with words like:
        - "We understand how it feels to..."
        - "Nobody, should have to experience..."
    - Expressing empathy isn't difficult, but is more than a clever slogan.  Customers are looking for signs they have something in common with the brand.  Don't be fake.
2. **Demonstrates Authority**
    - Find ways to demonstrate authority, without being a know-it-all, or preaching to the customer.
    - Recommended mechanisms for expressing authority include:
        - Testimonials
            - Let Others do the talking.  Pick 3-5 concise (non-rambling) testimonials that satisfied customers have given you.
        - Statistics
            - How many satisfied customers have you helped?
            - How much money did you help them save?
            - What percentage have their business grown as a direct output of you helping them?
        - Awards
            - If you've won some awards, include those awards at the bottom of your page.  Don't make a big deal about them.
        - Logos
            - If you provide a B2B product or service, put logos of known businesses you've worked with in your marketing collateral.
