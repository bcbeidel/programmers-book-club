# Chapter 4: A Character

The customer is the hero, not your brand. The story opens with a hero who wants something.  Framing the message around the customer and their desires should be the focus. **Pare down the Customer's Ambition to a Single Focus**, having too many desires dilutes your objectives.

## Defining Something The Customer Wants: Examples

Financial Advisor
: "A Plan for Your Retirement"

College Alumni Association
: "Leave a Meaningful Legacy"

Fine-Dining Restaurant
: "A Meal Everybody Will Remember"

Real Estate Agent
: "The Home You've Dreamed About"

Bookstore
: "A Story to Get Lost In"

Breakfast Bars
: "A Healthy Start to Your Day"

## Choosing A Desire Relevant To Survival

By survival, the author means the primitive desire we all have to be safe, healthy, happy, and strong.  Survival simply means we have the economic and social means to eat, drink, reproduce, and stay physically safe.  Examples discussed in the text were:

- Conserving Financial Resources
- Conserving Time
- Building Social Networks
- Gaining Status
- Accumulating resources
- The Innate Desire to be generous
- The desire for meaning

## What is the Story Question for your customer

> Imagine your customer is a hitchhiker.  You pull over to give them a ride, and the one burning question on his mind is simply _Where are you going?_.  But has he approaches you to roll down the window and start talking about your mission statement, or how your grandfather built this car with his bare hands, or how your road-trip playlist is all 1980's alternative.  This person does not care.  All he wants to do is to get to San Francisco with a flower in his hair.

The customer should know exactly where we want to take them.  Would they be able to repeat back exactly what your brand offers?
