# Section 2.2: Has A Problem

**Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems.**  That problem is the `hook` that draws people into the story.  The more we talk about our customers' experience, the more interest they will have in the brand.

## Every Story Needs A Villain

A villain is the plot device to give conflict a clear point of focus.  Batman had the Joker; Luke had Darth Vader, Harry Potter had Voldemort. A good villain does not need to be a person but should have some essential characteristics.

1. **The Villain should be a root source.** Frustration is what a villain makes us feel; high taxes would be a better villain.
2. **The Villain should be relatable.** The villain should be immediately relatable.
3. **The Villain should be singular.** Too many, and the story lacks clarity.
4. **The Villain should be real.** Avoid fear-mongering

## Three Levels Of conflict

Customers are trying to resolve problems at multiple levels, not just the external level that we associate with the villain.

1. External Problems
    - A Restaurant solves the external problem of hunger.  A plumber solves the external problem of a leaky pipe.
    - Many make the mistake of stopping here when describing the problems
2. Internal Problems:
    - The external problems are causing frustrations, and it is those internal frustrations that are motivating customers to call.
    - What is customer frustration?  How does our offering solve it?
    - The Apple example: People are intimidated by the tech talk associated with computers; they just want something easy to use. Apple provided easy to use computers that just worked, without forcing the tech talk on them.
3. Philosophical Problems
    - This is about something more significant than the story itself.  Why does the story matter?
    - Why is it important that Tommy Boy Saves his dad's company?  Because the people who are trying to take it are thieves and shouldn't succeed.
    - Why is it important that Hamlet avenge his Father's death?  Because otherwise, his Uncle would get away with murder.
    - The terms `ought` and `should` are the terms we should discuss the philosophical problems within. 
        - "Bad people shouldn't be allowed to win."
        - "People ought to be treated fairly."
    - Pet Store Example: Pet's deserve healthy food.
    - What is the grand injustice? What wrong *must* be righted?

## The Perfect Brand Promises

We should position our brand as the resolution to external, internal, and philosophical problems and frame our product's purchase as the action required to create closure.  Some examples:

1. Tesla Cars
    - Villain: Gas Guzzling, inferior technology.
    - External: I need a car.
    - Internal: I want to be an early adopter of new technology.
    - Philosophical: My choice of car ought to have a positive impact on the environment.
2. Nespresso Home Coffee Machines
    - Villain: Coffee machines that make bad coffee.
    - External: I want better coffee at home.
    - Internal: I want my home coffee machine to make me feel sophisticated.
    - Philosophical: I shouldn't have to be a barista to make gourmet coffee at home
3. Edward Jones Financial Advisors
    - Villain: Financial firms that don't listen to their customers.
    - External: I need investment help.
    - Internal: I'm confused on how to do this.
    - Philosophical: If I'm going to invest my money, I deserve an advisor who sill thoughtfully explain things in person.

## Action Required: Clarify The Message, So Customers Listen - Has a Problem

1. **Stop, Breathe.**
2. Brainstorm all the villains your brand stands against.
3. Brainstorm all the external problems that your brand resolves.  Is there one that represents the broadest swath of products?
4. Brainstorm all the internal problems (frustration or doubt).  Is there one that stands out as universal to all your customers?
   - Is your brand part of a larger, more important story?  Is there a philosophical wrong you stand against?
5. Capture the ideas.
