# Chapter 12: Building A Better Websites

Chances are, the website you have (or are inclined to build) has way more content than required and is delivering the noise we want to avoid.  Instead, we should air on the side of simplicity, and focus on a smaller set features.  For instance, the following list is a set of things your website should include.

1. An Offer Above The Fold
    - Consider this a first date; Customers should understand your intention quickly.
    - In concise images or text, your customer should identify one of the following from the information above the fold.
        1. They promise an aspirational identity.
        2. They promise to solve the problem.
        3. They state exactly what they do.
2. An Obvious Call To Actions
    - Top Right, or Dead Center.  People can in a Z pattern.
    - Make sure these are different colors and called out effectively
3. Images Of Successes
    - Communicate a sense of health, well-being, and a picture of what life could be with your product.
4. Bite-Sized Breakdown Of Your Revenue Streams
    - How do you make money? What service do you offer?  Can a customer quickly identify these?
5. Very few words
    - People don't read, they scan in chunks.
    - Need that long text? consider a 'read more' button to not distract someone if they aren't interested in that element.

Stay on the script.  You have the text from your Brand Script.  Use it.
