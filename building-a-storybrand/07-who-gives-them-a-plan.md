# Chapter 7: Who Gives Them A Plan

**Customers trust a guide who has a plan.** Commitments are risky for customers because, as soon as they commit, they can lose something.  Consider the customer on the edge of a rushing creek.  If they genuinely want the thing on the other side, but here a waterfall downstream.  There is a risk associated with their journey.  Our goal as the guide is to provide stones in the water to allow the customer to cross to their final objective. The

## The Plan Creates Clarity

Plans take many forms, but all effective plans do one of two things. However

1. Clarify how someone can do business with us
2. Remove that sense of risk someone might have before using our products or services.

## The Process Plan

To explain how someone can do business with us, it can be straightforward. Take, for example, if selling an expensive service, the plan could be.

1. Schedule an appointment.
2. Allow us to create a customized plan.  
3. Let's Execute the plan together.

A Software offering could provide a 'post-purchase' plan, such as...

1. Download the software.
2. Integrate your database into our system.
3. Revolutionize your customer interaction.

These plans can help customers before or after the purchase of a product or service.  The author recommends at least three but no more than six, clear steps that tell the customer what will be done at each step.  More complex detail will make the journey to do business with you more complicated, not simpler.

## The Agreement Plan

Think of this as a list of agreements you make with your customer.  These are designed to help your customer overcome the fear of doing business with you.  Take Carmax; for instance, they have an agreement plan focused on addressing their customers' concerns.  

- No-Haggle Pricing (I am afraid of getting hosed by a salesman)
- Refuse to sell cars that don't meet their standards (I'm scared I'll buy a lemon.)

This can occur in the background; they don't have to be featured on the home page.  To build one, list all of the things your customer might be concerned about related to your product or service, then counter with a list of agreements that alleviate their fears.

## Naming the Plan

Name the plan, something that conveys value to your customer. (e.g., 'Easy Installation Plan,' 'World's best night sleep plan,' 'Customer Satisfaction Guarantee')

## Clarify Your Message, So Customers Listen - Who Gives Them A Plan

1. **Stop, Breathe.**
