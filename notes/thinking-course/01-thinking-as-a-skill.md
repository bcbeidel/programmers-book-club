## Thinking as a Skill

The author queues up the book with two opposing perspectives:

1. Thinking is a matter of intelligence, and a fixed attribute that cannot be improved.
2. Thinking is a skill, that can be improved by training like any other skill.

Rather than taking one of these two positions explicitly, he proposes a combination through the analogy of a driving a car.  Intelligence is the engine (i.e., the horsepower) which in itself does not make the car go further or faster, instead it requires a skilled driver (i.e., Thinking) to be useful. `Intelligence is potential, Thinking is an operating skill.`  In other words, regardless of base-level intelligence, thinking 'skills' can be trained for more effective usage of that intelligence.

A few highlighted concepts from the remainder of the chapter:

- **The intelligence trap** represents a series of habits that intelligent people can fall into that severely limit their thinking:
  - Intelligent people can create stronger arguments for bad ideas, more likely to defend them
  - Proving someone else wrong is quick validation for intelligence, may result in squashing of good ideas.
- **Deliberate practice is required.** If you practice bad thinking, the habits will take over.
- **Perception** represents the inputs into thinking.  Like in software, flawed inputs are more likely to result in flawed outputs (garbage in, garbage out).
- The tools in this book are **attention directing devices**.  Focusing attention to avoid mistakes.
