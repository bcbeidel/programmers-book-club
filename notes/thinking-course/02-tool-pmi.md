## Tool: The PMI

**PMI** stands for **Plus**, **Minus**, **Interesting**.  Given a problem, take 2-3 minutes focusing on first listing out the positive points (plus), then the negative (minus), and finally the interesting or thoughts (It would be interesting if X...) that might not necessarily fit neatly in either category.

This should be done in two separate steps, first is going through each phase and enumerating points in turn.  Second, is to respond to the whole of the points.

## Practice

### What would you think of the suggestion that everyone should wear a badge showing their mood?
  
- Plus
  - It would provide an opportunity for children and people who cannot express their emotions effectively to convey their current state of mind, allowing for caretakers to respond effectively
  - It could serve as an impetus for more clear communication about emotional needs during human interaction (work, relationships, etc.)
- Minus
  - It would not allow for people to maintain internal emotional state, and would be potentially disruptive in delicate situations such as negotiations, where showing emotional responses would give away information.
  - In customer-service scenarios, it may be expected that the representatives are not only polite, but that they show positive emotional states despite the scenarios
  - The automatic disclosure of emotional state would be perceived as invasive into the internal emotional state and thinking of the individual
  - A mandate would be perceived as an infringement of an individual rights
  - In some cases, it may encourage the treatment of an emotional state, rather than trying to understand the source of an extreme emotional state
- Interesting
  - It would be interesting to understand the time-distributions of emotional state throughout the day, and how it relates to mental health.
  - What nuances of emotions would be represented?  
  - How would emotional 'scales' would be leveraged?
  - What would be the mechanism for enacting such a suggestion?
  - Since people do not manifest emotions in identical ways, would they be represented identically?
