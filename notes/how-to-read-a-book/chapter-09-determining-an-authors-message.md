# Chapter 9: Determining an Author's Message

> propositions are nothing but expressions of personal opinion unless they are supported by reasons. (p. 114)

- Key words such as _if_, _then_, _therefore_, _follows_ often indicate explicit arguments that the author is making.

> An argument is always  a set or series of statements of which some provide dthe grounds or reasons for what is to be concluded. (p. 114)

Valid arugments occur when the conclusion follow the supporting premisies, however, that does not mean that the conclusion is true.

Terms -> Propositions -> Arguments

# Sentences vs. Propositions

> Sentences and paragraphs are grammatical units.  They are units of language.  Propositions and arguments are logical units, or units of thought and knowledge.

- Propositions stand as the answers to the questions that the author poses.  
- They are declarative, where the sentences that pose those questions are interrogative.  

> RULE 6. Mark the most importance sentences in a book and discover the propositions they contain.
> RULE 7. Locate or construct teh basic arguments in the book by finding them in the connecting sentences.

# Finding the Key Sentences

> the heart of his communication lies in the major affirmations and denials he is making, and the reasons for doing so (p. 120)

Things that can higlight these sentences

- typographical devices
- the use of important words

# Finding the Propositions

Complicated sentences often contain multiple propositions.  Enumerate and restate them in your own words.

# Finding the Arguments

> There are many paragraphs in any book that do not express an argument at all -- perhaps net even part of one.  They may consist of collection of sentences that detail evidence or report how evidence has been gathered.  As there are sentences of secondary importance. (p. 128)

Again, being able to restate the argument inidcates that you 'get it' as the reader.  But how do you find the argument?

1. Remember every argument must involve a number of comprising statements.
2. Discriminate between arguments that point to explicit facts as evidence (inductive) and one that uses a series of genral statements to prove some generality (deductive)
3. Observe and identify the authors assumptions (are they agreed-upon, or some sort of self-evident truth/tautology)

# Finding The Solutions

RULE 8.  Find out what the authors solutions are.
