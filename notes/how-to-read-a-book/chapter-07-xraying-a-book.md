# Chapter 7: X-raying a Book

> RULE 2. State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences (a short paragraph) (p. 75)

This is not the same as classifying a book.  The key to this is describing it in _your own words_.

> RULE 3. Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole.

i.e., You should be able to summarize the contents of the book in a nested sense, again in your own words.

- In the book the author argued X.  
    - In order to support that, he provided reasons A, B, C.  
        - In describing A...
        - In describing B...
        - In describing C...

> Sometimes the author tells you the unity of his plan in the preface.  In this respect, informative books differ radically from fiction.  A scientific or philosophical writer has no reason to keep you in suspense.  In fact, the less suspense he keeps you in, the more likely you are to sustain the effort of reading his work through. Like a newspaper article, an expository book may summarize itself in its first paragraph. (p. 81)

Take the author's guide (or other guides) with a grain of salt.  You should be able to describe it in _your own words_.

How deep should the outline go?  It should go deep enough to demonstrate to yourself that you truly understand the arc of the text. 

Example:  If a two-year-old might say 'two plus two is four', though the statement is objectively true, it is unlikely that the statement came from the mathematical knowledge.  It could be said that is 

Keep in mind the diminishing returns on investment.  Your time is limited. 

> RULE 4. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR'S PROBLEMS WERE.  The author of a book starts with a question or set of questions.  The book ostensibly contains the answer or answers (p. 92)


## The First Stage of Analytical Reading, or rules for finding what a book is about

1. Classify the book according to the kind and subject matter.
2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.
3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.
4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.
