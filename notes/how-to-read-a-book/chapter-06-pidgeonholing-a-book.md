# Chapter 6: Pigeonholing a book

## The Importance of Classifying Books

> RULE 1. You must know what kind of book you are reading, and you should know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to read. (p. 60)

Is it _fiction_ or an _expository_ book.

- An expository book is one that conveys knowledge primarily, "knowledge" being constructed broadly. (p. 60)

## What You Can Learn from the Title of a Book

> ...the author thinks it is important for the reader to know the kind of book he is given.  That is why he goes to the trouble of making it plain in the preface and usually tries to make his title--or at least his subtitle--descriptive. (p. 63)

- The title can help you group books together, but some titles aren't so helpful

Example: Books about Mathematics (easy to see the relation in the title)
- Euclid's "Elements"
- Descartes' "Geometry"
- Hilbert's "Foundations of Geometry"

Example: The titles don't provide as much context, but perusing the contents would help sort them out
- "The City of God"
- "Leviathan"
- "Social Contract"
These are all political treatises

## Practical vs. Theoretical Books

Practical books 
- Provide rule of operation
- What do you do to change the scenario?
- Use words such as 'should', 'ought', 'good', 'bad', 'ends', and 'means' frequently

Theoretical books 
- teach you that something is the case
- frequently uses words such as 'is', 'not', 'should', 'ought'

## Kinds of Theoretical Books
 
Adler suggests 3 subdivisions of theoretical books: history, science, and philosophy.

- History
  - a book about something that occurred at a particular date in the past
  - _chronotopic_ - Of or pertaining to a specific time and place
- Science
  - Is not concerned with the past, it can take at any time or place 
  - Seeks laws or generalizations
  - Supports the argument with reproducible observations
- Philosophy
  - Seeks general truths
  - Bases argument on common experience
  - 'armchair thinking'

> This does not mean that the philosopher is a pure thinker and the scientist is merely an observer.  Both have to observe and think, but they think about different sorts of observations.  And however they may have arrived at the conclusions that they want to prove, they prove them in different ways, the scientist by pointing to the results of his special experiences, the philosopher by pointing to experiences that are common to all. (p. 72)
