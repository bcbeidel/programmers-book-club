# Chapter 11: Agreeing or Disagreeing with an Author

## Prejudice and Judgment 

- Acknowledge the emotions you bring to a dispute
- Make your assumptions explicit
- Attempt to be impartial

## Judging the Author's Soundness

1. "You are uninformed" 
    - The author lacks some relevant piece of knowledge. State it, and show how it is relevant. 
2. "You are misinformed"
    - The author claims to have knowledge that is not the case.
3. "You are illogical -- your reasoning is not cogent"
    - The author has committed some fallacy in reasoning or drawn a conclusion that is inconsistent with the evidence.

> If you have not been able to show that the author is uninformed, misinformed, or illogical on relevant matters, you simply cannot disagree. You simply cannot disagree.  You must agree.  You cannot say, as so many students and others do, "I find nothing wrong with your premise, and no errors in reasoning, but I don't agree with your conclusions." (p. 158)


## Judging the Author's Completeness

4. "Your analysis is incomplete"
    - The author hasn't solved all the problems he began with.

If you agree with book in part, and cannot make a proper criticism on the grounds of soundess of argument, you can still "suspend judgement"

## Rules for Analytical Reading

### What is the book about as a whole? 

1. Classify the book
2. Restate the contents, briefly and in your own words
3. Outline the major parts, and restate as you did the whole
4. Identify the problems the author is trying to solve

### What is being said in detail, and how?

5. Identify the key terms (i.e., concepts) from the author
6. Find the important sentences, identify which are propositions that support arguments
7. Restate the author's arguments
8. Account for problems that the author did or did not solve with their arguments

### Criticizing the book Fairly:  Is it true? What of it?

9. Don't criticize until you can say that you 'understand' the book.  Once you do, then you can say 'I agree,' OR 'I disagree,' OR 'I suspend judgment.'
10. Don't disagree combatively, or with emotional bias, assume there is a way to bridge the gap
11. Understand the difference between knowledge and personal opinions, support your argument with sound evidence and reasoning

Ways you can critique the author:

12. Show where the author is uninformed
13. Show where the author is misinformed
14. Show where the author is illogical
15. Show where the author analysis is incomplete
