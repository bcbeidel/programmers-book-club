# EC2 Overview

## EC2 101

Elastic Compute Cloud - Virtual Machines in the cloud

Changed economies of computing, now you only pay for the compute you use...

## EC2 Options

- **On Demand:**  Pay a fixed rate by the hour (or second) with no commitment

- **Reserved:**  provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance.  1 or 3 year terms

- **Spot:** Enables you to bid the price you want for your compute, for even greater savings if you have flexible start and end times

- **Dedicated Hosts:** Dedicated hosts for your use.  Allows you to use existing server-bound hardware licenses (i.e., Oracle)

## Instance Types

Probably, don't need this for exam.
