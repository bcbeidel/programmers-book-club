# Chapter 13: Using Storybrand To Transform Company Culture

The Narrative Void occurs when no shared story keeps everyone aligned.  The executive vision or corporate mission statements lack the compelling story that would otherwise provide a cohesive story for employees.  A clear story gives a clear sense of mission, with a shared objective of transforming the customer to their aspirational identity.  Rather than focusing on disambiguated core values, instead, focus on how our work is in service to a customer (internal or external), and empowering them to solve their problems.

The author suggests that the same framework for SB7 can provide a mechanism for delivering that consolidated story.
