# KDD 2020: Notes

This is a collection of notes from selected KDD talks and tutorials.  Below, are highlighted tutorial or tracks, (with some descriptions from the KDD Proceedings Page <https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/proceedings/>) and a link to my notes, in a seperate markdown file.

## Tutorial: Causal Inference Meets Machine Learning

Peng Cui, Zheyan Shen, Sheng Li, Liuyi Yao, Yaliang Li, Zhixuan Chu, Jing Gao

> Causal inference has numerous real-world applications in many domains such as health care, marketing, political science and online advertising. Treatment effect estimation, a fundamental problem in causal inference, has been extensively studied in statistics for decades. However, traditional treatment effect estimation methods may not well handle large-scale and high-dimensional heterogeneous data. In recent years, an emerging research direction has attracted increasing attention in the broad artificial intelligence field, which combines the advantages of traditional treatment effect estimation approaches (e.g., matching estimators) and advanced representation learning approaches (e.g., deep neural networks). In this tutorial, we will introduce both traditional and state-of-the-art representation learning algorithms for treatment effect estimation. Background about causal inference, counterfactuals and matching estimators will be covered as well. We will also showcase promising applications of these methods in different application domains.

## Tutorial: Data Pricing -- From Economics to Data Science

Jian Pei

> Data are invaluable. How can we assess the value of data objectively and quantitatively? Pricing data, or information goods in general, has been studied and practiced in dispersed areas and principles, such as economics, data management, data mining, electronic commerce, and marketing. In this tutorial, we present a unified and comprehensive overview of this important direction. We examine various motivations behind data pricing, understand the economics of data pricing, review the development and evolution of pricing models, and compare the proposals of marketplaces of data. We cover both digital products, such as ebooks and MP3 music, and data products, such as data sets, data queries and machine learning models. We also connect data pricing with the highly related areas, such as cloud service pricing, privacy pricing, and decentralized privacy preserving infrastructure like blockchains.

## Workshop: Data Science with Human In the Loop (DaSH)

> The goal of this workshop is to stimulate research on human-computer cooperation challenges in data science. We aim to bring together interdisciplinary researchers from academia, research labs and practice to share, exchange, learn, and develop preliminary results, new concepts, principle, and methodologies for understanding and improving human-computer cooperation along data science pipelines. We expect the workshop to help develop and grow a strong community of researchers who are interested in this topic, and yield future collaborations and scientific exchanges at the intersection of data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, information retrieval, data and knowledge management, human factors, human-computer interaction, data visualization, and user interfaces. The workshop will focus on understanding how to leverage respective strengths of humans and computers along the data science pipeline and in a wide range of data science tasks and real-life applications.
