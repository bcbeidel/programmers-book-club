# Takeaways from Range

I perceived this book as the counterpoint to the 10,000 hour rule.  Through examples in sports, business, politics, science and other stories of history the author makes a case for broad, sampled experiences, and mental models that those experiences provide.  

The underlying thesis requires the identification of an area of pursuit as either _kind_ or _wicked_.  The author makes the case that deliberate practice (i.e., the 10,000 hour rule) can provide value in _kind_ learning environments where the rules don't change and feedback is quick deliberate (think Golf, Chess, spelling bees, etc.).  

However, not all environments meet those criteria.  The author makes the case the _wicked_ environments do not benefit from the same deliberate practice because the rules change frequently and feedback (i.e., payoff) is not immediate (science, technology, business, team sports, etc.).  The author goes on to make the case that these environments benefit from a broader set of experiences, from which use of lateral experiences provide benefit.

Some of the bite-size take-aways for me were.

1. Seek broad experiences
2. Try to identify the mental models associated with those experiences
3. When tackling a problem, start by identifying as many solutions as possible, again seek
4. Work with heterogeneous teams, get broad inputs
5. Be prepared to abandon your existing toolsets and bias
6. Understand that 'grit' is not always the right option, learning how/when to quit going down a path is a skill.
7. There is nothing wrong with specialization, in fact we all tend to do it at one point or another, that doesn't mean we can't draw from the outside to attach

## Key Terms

- **kind learning environments**: patterns repeats over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually rapid.  Think golf or chess.  The scenarios (piece positions) or (golf strokes repeat) over and over. Accommodating to deliberate practice.

- **wicked learning environments**: the 'rules of the game' are unclear or incomplete, no repetitive patterns may exist or may not be obvious, and feedback is delayed, inaccurate, or both.  These are the environments where broad 

- **Chunking** refers to an approach for making more efficient use of short-term memory by grouping information. Chunking breaks up long strings of information into units or chunks. The resulting chunks are easier to commit to memory than a longer uninterrupted string of information.

- **sampling period**, for skill development, where a skill-gainer tries multiple areas prior to pursuing deep specialization

## Reference Papers

Author discussed Gary Klein (focused on chess & importance of experience) & Daniel Kahneman (famous for identifying the failings of bias of experts), with competing perspectives on usefulness experience on success in a domain. "Do specialist get better with experience or not?" (p. 20)

To be honest, I feel like I suffered from some frequency bias here (a.k.a., [Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion)) going through my podcast feed and found some snippets material that reminded me of this book.
