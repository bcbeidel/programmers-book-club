# Introduction

In the introduction, the author starts with the stories to contrast generalization (Roger Federer) and early specialization (Tiger Woods).  During this intro the author introduces the concept of a **sampling period**, for skill development, where a skill-gainer tries multiple areas prior to pursuing deep specialization.  Federer experienced this sampling period with many ball-sports prior to specializing in tennis until he was a teenager.

After short summaries of the respective athlete's rise the author touches other categories of professionals who may fall into the respective categories.

- Military service members transitioning into civilian life (generalists)
- Bank mis-management and silos (specialist)
  - one department specifically lowered monthly payments for home owners during financial crisis
  - another department identified lowered payments, ended up foreclosing on homes
- UK recruiting adults into new sports for olympics (generalists)

## Chapter 1: Cult of the Head Start

Post WWII, Lazlo Polgar, Hungarian, sought to prove specialization was achievable in any discipline, with deliberate development steps. Raised multiple children with deliberate, early, focused training (i.e., deliberate practice) in chess.  His daughters Susan, Sofia, Judit all raised to some level of prominence in the game of chess.  

> Seen as powerful example of 10,000 hour rule. However, this assumes that all subjects can be tackled in the same way that chess, or golf can.

Author discussed Gary Klein (focused on chess & importance of experience) & Daniel Kahneman (famous for identifying the failings of bias of experts), with competing perspectives on usefulness experience on success in a domain. "Do specialist get better with experience or not?" (p. 20)

The author's summary, the nature of the domain matters.  There are 'kind' and 'wicked' domains. Terms credited to Robin Hogarth.

- **kind learning environments**: patterns repeats over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually rapid.  Think golf or chess.  The scenarios (piece positions) or (golf strokes repeat) over and over. Accommodating to deliberate practice.

- **wicked learning environments**: the 'rules of the game' are unclear or incomplete, no repetitive patterns may exist or may not be obvious, and feedback is delayed, inaccurate, or both.

Discussed development and introduction of AI into domain of chess.  Computers are very good at repeated pattern recognition (tactics), have done very well at single repeated games of standard chess.  Multiple iterations of AI (Deep Blue, AlphaZero), the author talks about the introduction 'centaur' teams of human + AI that have outperformed solo acts.

Author continues to build case across domains where top performers in a field where they "have one foot outside" their primary domain.

- E.g., Nobel winning scientists who are amateur musicians, artists, woodworkers, poets, and authors. (p. 33)
- Steve Jobs citing calligraphy class as inspiration some apple designers (p. 33)
- Familiarity with boolean logic and phone routing systems allowing for electronic transfer of any information. (p. 34)

In part, each of these scenarios, top performers were thought to use the external experiences as 'circuit breakers', interrupting an over-reliance on the same patterns.

## Other Key Terms

- **Chunking** refers to an approach for making more efficient use of short-term memory by grouping information. Chunking breaks up long strings of information into units or chunks. The resulting chunks are easier to commit to memory than a longer uninterrupted string of information.
