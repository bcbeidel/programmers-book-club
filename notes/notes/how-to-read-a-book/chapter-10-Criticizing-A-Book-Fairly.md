# Chapter 10: Criticizing a Book Fairly

> RULE 9. You must be able to say, with reasonable certainty, "I understand," before you can say any one of the following things: "I agree," or "I disagree," or "I suspend judgment."

> RULE 10.  When you disagree, do so reasonably, and do not disputatiously or contentiously

When you disagree with the author, assume there is a resolution.  The removal of understanding or ignorance could correct it.  This is not a 'hall pass' to an author to peddle unsupported opinions as reasoned statements of knowledge. 

> RULE 11. Respect the difference between knowledge and mere personal option by giving reasons for any critical judgment you make.
