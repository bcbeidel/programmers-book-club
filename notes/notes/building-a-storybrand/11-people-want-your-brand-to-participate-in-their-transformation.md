# Chapter 11: People want you to participate in their transformation

> Everyone wants to change.  Everybody wants to be somebody different, somebody better, perhaps, somebody who becomes more self-accepting.

We have to ask ourselves a few important questions when we're representing our brand: Who does our customer want to become? What kind of person do they want to be? What is their aspirational identity?

## Defining an Aspirational Identity

Try to answer the questions.

- Who does the customer want to become?
- How does your customer WANT to be described by others?

## Great Brands Obsess About The Transformation Of Their customers

Who does your customer want to become as they relate to your products and services? Brands recognize that their customers are human, filled with emotion, driven to transform. Some examples of identity transformation include:

1. Pet Food Brand
    - From: Passive Dog Owner
    - To: Every dog's here
2. Financial Advisor
    - From: Confused and ill-equipped
    - To: Competent and smart
3. Shampoo Brand
    - From Anxious and glum
    - To: Carefree and radiant
