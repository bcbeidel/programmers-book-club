# Chapter 10: And Ends In Success

**Never assume people understand how your brand can change their lives. Tell them.**  Successful brands and leaders make it clear what life will look like if somebody engages their products or services.  Without vision, people and brands will both perish.  The ending should be specific and clear, with a simple before and after.  Consider the exercise with the following grid.

|                              | Before Your Brand | After Your Brand |
|------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| What do they have?           |                   |                  |
| What are they feeling?       |                   |                  |
| What is an average day like? |                   |                  |
| What is their status?        |                   |                  |

Ultimately, these are framing devices to help tell the customer success story. There are some dominant themes for storytellers to end stories allowing the hero to:

1. Win some sort of power or position.
2. Be unified with somebody or something that makes them whole.
3. Experience some kind of self-realization, that also makes them whole.

These can map to some fundamental human desires, outlined in later sections.

## Winning Power And Position (The Need For Status)

Part of survival means gaining social status, some ways we can offer that could include:

1. Offer Access
    - Membership gets you X features that others don't get
2. Create Scarcity
    - Offer a limited number of a specific item; Think "limited" on the back of jeeps.
3. Offer A Premium
    - Perks for customers, diamond clubs with special recognition
4. Offer Identify association
    - i.e., buy the brand name, Rolex, Mercedes, etc.

## Union That Makes the Hero Whole (The Need For Something External to Create Completeness)

Love stories are where the mind goes to first. However, it is more about the hero being deficient somehow, then gaining the other half to their whole. Some of the benefits of "filling their need" include.

Some examples:

1. Reduced Anxiety
    - Will your product provide peace-of-mind?  A less stressful life?  
2. Reduced Workload
    - Are you offering a tool that will make them superhuman?
3. More Time
    - Will your tool or service give them more time to solve all their other problems?  Will they be able to 'fit it all in'?

## Ultimate Self-Realization or Acceptance (The Need To Reach Our Potential)

Messages of self-acceptance or self-improvement may resonate.  The 2013 Dove 'Real Beauty' commercials are a prime example of the author on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=litXW91UauE).  The ideas associated with this component included:

1. Inspiration
    - Can your brand be associated with an inspirational feat? (Red Bull, HBR, Under Armor, GMC, Nike)
2. Acceptance
    - Can you get people to accept themselves as they are?  (e.g., Dove Commercials)
3. Transcendence
    - Can you invite customers to participate in something larger than themselves? (Tom's Shoes, FUBU)

## Keep It Simple

Don't overthink it.  What problem are you trying to resolve in your customers life, and what does resolution look like?  Stick to basic answers.  Dig deeper as you get better, dig deeper.

## Clarify Your Message, So Customers Listen - And Ends In Success

1. **Stop, Breathe.**
2. Brainstorm the successful resolution you're helping your customers achieve?  What will their lives look like if you use your products and services?
