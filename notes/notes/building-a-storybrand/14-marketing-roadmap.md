# The Storybrand Marketing Road Map

1. Create a One-Liner
2. Create a Lead Generator, and Collect Email Addresses
3. Create an automated email-drip campaign
4. Collect and Tell Stories of Transformation
5. Create a system that generates referrals

## Road Map Task 1: Create A One-Liner

Craft a compelling one-liner; it doesn't have to be a single sentence, nor does it have to be four sentences.  Instead, it needs to distill the core elements of your Storybrand's character, problem, plan, and successes.  See the examples below, but consider this an iterative process, keep repeating and refining until people are interested and understand what you offer.

### Examples

- The Character: Soccer moms
- The Problem: Busy Schedules
- The Plan: Short Meaningful Workouts
- The Success: Health and Renewed Energy

"We provide busy moms with a short, meaningful workout they can use to stay healthy and have renewed energy."

- The Character: Retired Couples
- The Problem: A Second Mortgage
- The Plan: A time-share option
- The Success: Avoiding those cole, northern winters

"We help retired couples who want to escape the harsh cold avoid the hassle of a second mortgage while still enjoying Florida's warm, beautiful weather in the winter."

### How To Use The One-liner

1. Memorize; Repeat over and over again
2. Have your team memorize the one-liner
3. Include it on the website
4. Repeat it in every piece of marketing material possible

## Road Map Task 2: Create A Lead-Generator and collect email-addresses

Email is noisy, and customers don't want a 'stay in the loop' email.  As a result, your lead generator must do the following:

1. Provide enormous value for your customers
2. Establish you as an authority in your field

Achieve this with one of five types of generators, be as generous as possible.

1. Downloadable Guide
2. Online Course or Webinar
3. Software Demo or a Free Trial
4. Free samples
5. Live events

## Road Map Task 3: Create An Automated Email Drip Campaign

The author recommends using email, even if you experience low open rates.  Unsubscribes are good, that is a non-customer opting out of your processes.  With potential customers, the author recommends a multi-week pattern, something like:

1. Nurturing Email
2. Nurturing Email
3. Nurturing Email
4. Sales Email With Call TO Action

### A Nurturing Email: A formula

1. Talk about the problem.
2. Describe a plan to solve the problem
3. Describe how life can look for the reader once the problem is solved.

### The Offer And Call To Action Email: A Formula

Don't be passive; be direct.

1. Talk about the problem.
2. Describe a product you offer that solves this problem.
3. Describe what life can look like for the reader, once the problem is solved.
4. Call the customer to direct action leading to a sale.

## Road Map Task 4: Collect And Tell Stories of Transformation

Great testimonials give future customers the gift of going second. The challenge lies in getting the right kind of testimonials.  We need to be very specific in our customers' requests for their testimonies; otherwise, we get responses that lack sufficient information for a compelling story.  Some questions you may consider to get better answers include:

1. What was the problem you were having before you discovered the product?
2. What did the frustration feel like as you tried to solve that problem?
3. What was different about our product?
4. Take us to the moment when you realized our product was working to solve your problem?
5. Tell us what life looks like now that your problem is solved or being solved.

## Road Map Task 5: Create a System That Generates Referrals

1. Identify your existing, ideal Customers
2. Give your customer a reason to spread the word
3. Offer a reward

Automate it.
