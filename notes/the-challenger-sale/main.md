### Short Synopsis:

Solution sales has particular burdens placed to understand both the customer and provider company.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **The Customer Burden of Solutions:** Customers expect to to actually "solve" a real problem and not just supply a reliable product.  This requires a deeper understanding of the customer's need and can lead to a more protracted 'discovery' period.  Specific trends that hinder getting this process right include:
	* **The Rise of Concensus-Based Sale:** More complex solutions often warrant more deliberate thought from customers, often requiring buy-in from all stakeholders.  (I.E. More people to please in an organization)
	* **Increased Risk Aversion:** Increased cost and complexity of solutions can leave customers skeptical that they will ever see the promised returns of a given solution
	* **Greater Demand of Customization:** Customer's tend to want to modify a given deal to fit their specific needs, otherwise why buy a solution if it doesn't fit the need.  _"Customization: Everyone wants it; no one wants to pay for it"_
	* **The Rise of Third Party Consultants:**  In the hopes of 'maximizing value' firms may hire conslutants to help navigate the complexity of evaluating and selecting a solution.  These consulants don't work for free, and most likely their extracted 'value' is going to come out of the side of the sales organization.

2. **A Widening Talent Gap:** 
	* Top performers can far outshine their core peers (Anectodal examples of double and triple levels of effectivness) 
	* The increasing complexity of solution sales gives small gains in individual performance an even greater impact on an organization's total sales
	* Failing to improve the 'average' sales performance can be catastropic for the same reason

## Chapter Two: The Challenger (Part 1): A New Model for High Performance

### Key Takeaways:

* There are Five Types of Sales Reps:
	1. **The Hard Worker:**  _These are the reps who show up early, stay late, and are always willing to put in the extra effort. _
	2. **The Relationship Builder:** _They are very generous with their time and work very hard to ensure that the customers' needs are met.  Their primary posture with customers is largely one of accessibility and service. "Whatever you need," They'll tell customers, "I'm here to make that happen.  Just say the word"_
	3. **The Lone Wolf:** _ they tend to follow their own instincts instead of the rules.  In many ways, the Lone Wolves are the "prima donnas" of the sales force -- the "cowboys" who do things "their way" or not at all._
	4. **The Reactive Problem Solver:** _ They tend to focus heavily on post sales follow-up, ensuring that service issues around implementation and execution are addressed quickly and thoroughly. _
	5. **The Challenger:** _Challengers are the debaters of the team.  They've got a deep understanding of the customer's business and use that understanding to push the customer's thinking and teach them something new about how their company can compete more effectively. _
