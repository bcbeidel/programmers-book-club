_Misconception: Adding salespeople grows revenue_

**Predictable Revenue** is preferable to one time spikes.  Spikes can cause excess stress from last minute, haphazard deal hustling that comes when sales are unpredictable.

### Three Keys to Predictable Revenue

1. Predictable Lead Generation is the top priority
2. Dedicated Sales Development team that bridges the gap between marketing and sales with 100% focus on prospecting for new clients
3. Consistent, repeatable sales system

### Hot Coals

The switch from organic growth to proactive growth.

> In high productivity sales organizations, salespeople do not _cause_ customer acquisition growth, they _fulfill_ it.

### Lead Generation Causes New Customer Acquisition

The author argues that the paradigm is shifting where sales will operate more like account management & growth responsibility falling on a dedicated demand generation group.

Prospecting is not a task that salespeople can effectively do on their own in sufficient volume to keep their pipelines full with regularity.  Primary exceptions are when the deals are very big, or the market is truly relationship based.

### Getting the Right Metrics

The current tendency is to set highly arbitrary goals, lacking the basis of history.

A better metric is based on the building of reliable lead generation.  However, this can take 2-12 months to build.  Such a process can be built considering the following.  Strong parallels to the 'Traction Book'.
- Trial and Error Lead Generation
- Marketing Through Teaching (establish yourself as a trusted expert in the space)
- Patience in building great word of mouth
- Cold Calling 2.00
- Building excited partner ecosystem
- PR

### Start with Awareness

- How many qualified leads does the company need each month?
- Is it tracked at the board level?
- **Is there a common language?**

Common language and clear metrics on the pipeline can help set more realistic sales goals.

## Chapter: Cold Calling 2.0

> The biggest bottleneck in prospecting companies that have more than a few executives isn't getting to the decision maker... it's finding them in the first place.

> The tipping point of the Cold Calling 2.0 process was born: sending mass emails to high-level executives to ask for referrals to the best person in their organization for the first conversation.


## The Death of Cold Calling

1. Buyers are sick of the classic pushy sales calls
2. Sales 2.0 tech makes it easier to make informed decisions based on Relationship
3. Need to show bang for the buck in marketing budgets

## Cold Calling 2.0

- Prospecting into cold accounts without making cold calls.

### Key Principles

1. _No Cold Calling_
  -- Less intrusive means to get the conversation you want.
2. _A focus on results, not activities_
  -- Keep an eye on metrics that matter.  Qualification calls per day qualified leads per month)
3. _Everything is systematically process-driven!_
  -- Management practices, hiring, training, etc.


  > Making the field salespeople do cold calls means having your highest-cost (per hour) sales resource perform the lowest-value (per hour) activity. (p.20)
