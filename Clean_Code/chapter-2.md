### Chapter Two: Meaningful Names
#### Short Synopsis: 
**Good names are important.**  Clear intent of code by way of deliberate naming saves time when coming back to change code. __(i.e. the reduction of cost of task switching through faster comprehension)__

___
#### Key Takeaways
1. **A good name answers the following questions:**
	* Why does it exist?
	* What does it do?
	* How is it used? 

2. **Some qualities of a good name include:**
	* **Avoids disinformation.**  Similar names suggest similarity of use/meaning.  Characters like 0 and l are difficult to distinguish.
	* **Makes Meaningful Distinctions.**  Noise words (*the*variable) and number-series naming (*a1, a2, a3*) are examples of distinctions that lack meaning.
	* **Reflects Natural Language.**  Provides easier communcation when discussing code, and reading it. Makes the code searchable.
	* **CLASSES and OBJECTS** names should use **NOUNS**  
	* **METHODS** names should use **VERBS**
	* **Avoid colloquialisms, turn-a-phrase, or puns.**  If it requires a specific background to understand it muddles the meaning
	* **One Word One Concept.**  Consitent verbage for concepts keeps it simple when switching around in code.
	* **Provides *sufficient* not *excessive* context**
