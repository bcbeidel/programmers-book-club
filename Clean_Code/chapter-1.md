### Chapter One: Clean Code
#### Short Synopsis: 
Bad code is expensive to maintain, modify and migrate from.  Clean code is less expensive to maintain and modify.  Time spent 'wading' through bad code is time lost to otherwise productive pursuits.

___
#### Key Takeaways
1. **Bad code is expensive to maintain.**  As we come back to make changes, it is harder to understand the impact of our changes in bad code making the changes take longer (and are more expensive)

2. **'Clean Code'** can have many definitions but some attributes from text included:
	* Can be read and modfied by someone other than the the origional author
	* The intent of the code is clear.  There are no suprises when looking at methods or objects.  I.E. you get what you are expecting
	* All components of the code, classes, functions etc... are focused on doing one thing and doing it well.
	* Includes and runs tests
	* Does not create excessively complex abstractions, and limits the number of classes and objects

3. **The Boy Scout Rule:** _'Try and leave this world a little better than you found it...'_
	* __We spend more time reading code than writing it.__  (10:1 ratio p.13)
	* When touching code, quick comprehension is key, 'making it easier to read actually makes it easier to write' (p.14)

#### Potential Discussion Questions:

**[Question]** There are an abundance of definitions of what defines 'Clean Code', do any in particular seem more or less pertinent to you?  Do any of these seem dated?
