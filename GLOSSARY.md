Perceived meanings for key terms from readings.  

# Affordance
The relationship between an object and a user that determines what actions are possible. 

# Constraint 
A restriction that helps avoid errors.

# Conceptual Affinity
The degree to which to ideas are related.  Ideas that are closely related have greater conceptual affinity, those that are loosely related have less conceptual affinity.

# Conceptual Model 
An explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works.

# Cyclomatic Complexity
The cyclomatic complexity of a section of source code is the number of linearly independent paths through this code. For instance, if the source code contained no decision points such as IF statements or FOR loops, the complexity would be 1, since there is only a single path through the code. If the code had one single-condition IF statement, there would be two paths through the code: one where the IF statement evaluates to TRUE and another one where it evaluates to FALSE. Two nested single-condition IFs, or one IF with dual conditions, therefore, would produce a complexity of 4. (Source: Wikipedia)

# Side Effect
In computer science, a function or expression is said to have a side effect if, in addition to returning a value, it also modifies some state or has an observable interaction with calling functions or the outside world. (Source: Wikipedia)

# Signifier 
Communicates where the action should take place.

# System Image. 
Needs Definition.

# Mapping 
The spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls of a system and the devices being controlled. (ex. car seat adjustment control)

# Polymorphism
In programming languages and type theory, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. A polymorphic type is a type whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type, or types. (Source: Wikipedia)

# Feedback 
Communicates the results of an action.
