# Material Design by Google

To truly do this justice, look at the live page from google. [[LINK]](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)

### What is Material?

Material is a metaphor used to inform design decisions in mobile and web applications.  In principle, it leverages the conceptual models from the physical world to provide indicators for functionality in applications.  The core of the metaphor requires a few baseline assumptions about material:

* Material exists in a 3D world.
* Material indicates its height through light and shadow
* Material is uniformly thick (1px)

#### Content

Content is independent of material.  It is applied to material and provides the 'meat' to the platform that is the Material.  When dealing with content, there are a few ideas to consider:

* Content does not add thickness to Material
* Content can behave independently of the Material, but is limited within the bounds of the Material.

#### Physical Attributes of Material

Getting a little more tactical when thinking about the attributes of Material, Google has key points to consider

* Material is solid.  
* No two pieces of material can occupy the same space (i.e., use elevation to separate)
* Material cannot pass through other Material
* Material can transform
* Material can change shape along the x and y-axis
* Material cannot bend or fold
* Material can split, heal, merge with other Material

#### [Moving material]((https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/material-properties.html#material-properties-transforming-material))

When moving material through space, Google had additional suggestions.

* Material can be generated or destroyed from anywhere
* Material can move along any axis
* Movement along the z-axis normally indicates user interaction

The rest of the text is focused on being a living document to provide tactile examples of how to implement these core concepts into web and mobile applications.  Check out their content at https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html
