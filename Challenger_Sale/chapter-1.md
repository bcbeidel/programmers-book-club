#### Key Takeaways:

1. **The Customer Burden of Solutions:** Customers expect to to actually "solve" a real problem and not just supply a reliable product.  This requires a deeper understanding of the customer's need and can lead to a more protracted 'discovery' period.  Specific trends that hinder getting this process right include:
	* **The Rise of Concensus-Based Sale:** More complex solutions often warrant more deliberate thought from customers, often requiring buy-in from all stakeholders.  (I.E. More people to please in an organization)
	* **Increased Risk Aversion:** Increased cost and complexity of solutions can leave customers skeptical that they will ever see the promised returns of a given solution
	* **Greater Demand of Customization:** Customer's tend to want to modify a given deal to fit their specific needs, otherwise why buy a solution if it doesn't fit the need.  _"Customization: Everyone wants it; no one wants to pay for it"_
	* **The Rise of Third Party Consultants:**  In the hopes of 'maximizing value' firms may hire conslutants to help navigate the complexity of evaluating and selecting a solution.  These consulants don't work for free, and most likely their extracted 'value' is going to come out of the side of the sales organization.

2. **A Widening Talent Gap:** 
	* Top performers can far outshine their core peers (Anectodal examples of double and triple levels of effectivness) 
	* The increasing complexity of solution sales gives small gains in individual performance an even greater impact on an organization's total sales
	* Failing to improve the 'average' sales performance can be catastropic for the same reason
