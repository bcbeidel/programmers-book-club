# Cold Calling 2.0

> The biggest bottleneck into prospecting companies that have more than a few executives isn't getting  to the decision maker... it's finding them in the first place.

> The tipping point of the Cold Calling 2.0 process was born: sending mass emails to high level executives to ask for referrals to the best person in their organization for the first conversation.
