## Predictable Revenue

#### _Misconception: Adding salespeople grows revenue_

**Predictable Revenue** is preferable to one time spikes.  Spikes can cause excess stress from last minute, haphazard deal hustling that comes when sales are unpredictable.

### Three Keys to Predictable Revenue
1. Predictable Lead Generation is the top priority
2. Dedicated Sales Development team that bridges the gap between marketing and sales with 100% focus on prospecting for new clients
3. Consistent, repeatable sales system

> In high productivity sales organizations, salespeople do not _cause_ customer acquisition growth, they _fulfill_ it.

### Lead Generation Causes New Customer Acquisition
The author argues that the paradigm is shifting where sales will operate more like account management & growth responsibility falling on a dedicated demand generation group.

Prospecting is not a task that salespeople can effectively do on their own in sufficient volume to keep their pipelines full with regularity.  Primary exceptions are when the deals are very big, or the market is truly relationship based.

### Getting the Right Metrics
The current tendency is to set highly arbitrary goals, lacking the basis of history.

A better metric is based upon the building of reliable lead generation.  However, this can take 2-12 months to build.  Such a process can be built considering the following.  Strong parallels to the 'Traction Book'.
- Trial and Error Lead Generation
- Marketing Through Teaching (establish yourself as a trusted expert in the space)
- Patience in building great word of mouth
- Cold Calling 2.00
- Building excited partner ecosystem
- PR

### Start with Awareness
- How much qualified pipeline doe sthe company need each month?
- Is it tracked at the board level?
- **Is there a common language?**

Common language, and clear metrics on pipeline can help set more realistic sales goals.
